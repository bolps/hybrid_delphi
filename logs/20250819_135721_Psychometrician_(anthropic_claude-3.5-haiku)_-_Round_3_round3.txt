### Psychometrician (anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku) - Round 3
I'll analyze the items for the "Coercive Control & Monitoring" dimension using the specified rubric. Here's the JSON output:

Note: The analysis provides a comprehensive evaluation of each item's fit, clarity, redundancy, and recommendation within the Coercive Control & Monitoring dimension.
