It includes surveillance, restriction of personal choices, and the creation of a climate of fear and self-censorship, all designed to maintain power and control. Psycholinguistically, it's marked by verbs of restriction and surveillance. Clinically, these behaviors foster dependency and hypervigilance, contributing to chronic anxiety and attachment insecurity.",

  "round3_synthesis": "Here's a summary of the Round 3 Delphi decisions:\n\n**Coercive Control & Monitoring:**\n*   **Retained (4):** IT23, IT24, IT20, IT12. IT23 and IT24 met all rubric thresholds (fit mean ≥4, IQR ≤1, clarity ≥4). IT20 and IT12 were retained via majority recommendation despite not meeting all initial thresholds.\n*   **Revised (1):** IT28. This item was flagged for revision due to a higher IQR (1.25), indicating some disagreement among panelists on its fit.\n*   **Dropped (3):** IT25, IT15, IT18. IT25 and IT15 were dropped due to high redundancy (≥0.50) with IT23, despite meeting other thresholds. IT18 was dropped by majority recommendation, also showing redundancy with IT28.\n\n**Emotional & Psychological Abuse:**\n*   **Retained (5):** IT29, IT16, IT27, IT39, IT14. All retained items met rubric thresholds for fit, IQR, and clarity.\n*   **Dropped (4):** IT31, IT30, IT41, IT13. IT31, IT30, and IT41 were dropped due to high redundancy (≥0.50) with IT29. IT13 was dropped due to redundancy with IT16.\n\n**Social Isolation & Jealousy:**\n*   **Retained (3):** IT11, IT10, IT21. These items met the rubric thresholds.\n*   **Dropped (2):** IT26, IT22. Both were dropped due to high redundancy (≥0.50) with IT11 and IT21, respectively.\n\n**Threats & Intimidation:**\n*   **Retained (3):** IT35, IT36, IT40, IT33. All met rubric thresholds.\n*   **Dropped (2):** IT37, IT34. Both were dropped due to high redundancy (≥0.50) with IT40 and IT33, respectively.\n\n**Physical Violence:**\n*   **Retained (1):** IT38. This item met all rubric thresholds.\n\n**Sexual Coercion:**\n*   **Retained (2):** IT42, IT32. Both items met all rubric thresholds.\n\n**Impact & External Concern:**\n*   **Retained (2):** IT17, IT19. Both met rubric thresholds.\n*   **Dropped (2):** IT43, IT09. Both were dropped due to high redundancy (≥0.50) with IT17 and IT19, respectively.\n\n**Healthy Relationship Indicators:**\n*   **Retained (5):** IT44, IT02, IT06, IT08, IT01. These items met rubric thresholds.\n*   **Dropped (4):** IT03, IT04, IT05, IT07. All were dropped due to high redundancy (≥0.50) with IT44, IT06, and IT08.\n\n**Unresolved Disagreements/Borderline Cases:**\n*   In \"Coercive Control & Monitoring,\" IT20 and IT12 were retained by majority recommendation despite not fully meeting the fit mean threshold, indicating some lingering ambiguity or lower consensus on their \"fit\" within the dimension.\n*   IT28 in \"Coercive Control & Monitoring\" requires revision due to higher rater disagreement (IQR > 1.0), suggesting clarity or wording issues.\n*   Across dimensions, the primary reason for dropping items was redundancy (pairwise redundancy ≥0.50) with other highly-rated items, ensuring a concise and non-overlapping set of indicators."
