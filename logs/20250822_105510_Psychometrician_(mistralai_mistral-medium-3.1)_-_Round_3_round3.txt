### Psychometrician (mistralai/mistral-medium-3.1) - Round 3
Here’s the strict JSON evaluation for item reduction, adhering to your schema and rubric. Redundancy and overlap assessments are based on semantic similarity *within* dimensions.

### Key Observations:
1. **Misassigned Items**:
   - **IT01**, **IT20**, **IT10** should move to **"Emotional Neglect & Lack of Support"**.
   - **IT28** fits better in **"Fear & Hyper-vigilance"** (mood swings create anxiety).

2. **Redundancies**:
   - **Emotional Abuse**: IT32 and IT30 overlap; IT17 and IT14 overlap.
   - **Coercive Control**: IT27 > IT12; IT24 > IT26; IT18 > IT09.
   - **Financial Abuse**: IT46 > IT48.

3. **High-Priority Retentions**:
   - Core items like **IT30** (insults), **IT27** (isolation), **IT47** (financial control), **IT39** (physical violence), and **IT29** (hyper-vigilance) are indispensable.

4. **Revisions Needed**:
   - Clarify **IT16** (specify "digital surveillance"), **IT44** (specify "anticipatory fear"), and **IT05** (merge with IT06 or specify "solitude denial").

5. **Drops**:
   - Redundant (e.g., IT12, IT26) or tangential (e.g., IT28) items where stronger alternatives exist.
