### **Key Observations for Scale Refinement**:
1. **Coercive Control**:
   - **Retain core**: IT26, IT46, IT48, IT23 (post-revision), IT45/IT46 (merged).
   - **Drop/move**: IT20, IT21, IT22 (→ *Emotional Abuse*), IT10 (→ *Coercive Control*), IT12 (redundant).
   - **Revise**: IT15 (add control context), IT23 (split into 2 items).

2. **Emotional Abuse**:
   - **Retain core**: IT31, IT30, IT29, IT41, IT39, IT16.
   - **Add**: IT20, IT21, IT22 (from *Coercive Control*), IT27 (→ *Threats*).
   - **Revise**: IT13 (specify *constant* belittling).

3. **Threats/Intimidation**:
   - **Retain core**: IT40, IT36, IT35, IT33, IT32.
   - **Add**: IT27 (from *Emotional Abuse*).
   - **Revise**: Merge IT37 with IT40.

4. **Fear/Trauma**:
   - **Retain core**: IT17, IT28, IT18.
   - **Revise**: Merge IT43 with IT17.

5. **Healthy Dynamics**:
   - **Retain core**: IT06, IT44, IT07, IT04, IT03, IT02, IT08.
   - **Drop**: IT05 (redundant with IT04).
   - **Revise**: Merge IT01 with IT02.

6. **External Validation**:
   - **Retain**: IT19 (strongest).
   - **Revise**: Merge IT09 with IT19.

### **Suggested Next Steps**:
- **Pilot test** revised items (especially merged/split ones) for clarity and dimensional fit.
- **Check factor loadings** post-revision to ensure items load cleanly on intended dimensions.
- **Assess internal consistency** (α/Cronbach’s) per subscale after reductions.
