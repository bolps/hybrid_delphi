### Clinical Psychologist (anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku)
Based on the items provided, I'll group them into several key psychological constructs related to relational dynamics and emotional abuse:

1. Psychological Control and Manipulation
- Tries to control who I see and what I do
- Prevents me from seeking independent work
- Asks me to justify every purchase
- Controls how I spend my money
- Prevents access to my bank account or economic resources
- Demands proof of love and fidelity
- Feels like constant messaging/calling

Rationale: These items represent systematic attempts to limit personal autonomy and financial independence.

2. Emotional Abuse and Gaslighting
- Puts me down, insults, or criticizes me
- Makes me feel wrong and says it's my fault if they're unhappy
- Tells me I'm worth nothing and would be alone without them
- After aggression, denies it happened and makes me doubt my perception
- Has strong mood swings (aggressive then apologetic)

Rationale: These behaviors systematically undermine self-esteem and create psychological confusion.

3. Social Isolation Tactics
- Speaks badly of friends/speaks against seeing them
- Asks me not to see friends/family
- Doesn't want me to see family or friends
- Suggests I'm neglecting them if I have other commitments

Rationale: Strategies designed to cut off external support networks.

4. Physical and Sexual Coercion
- Physical aggression (grabbing, hitting, choking)
- Persistent sexual demands without consent
- Threats of physical harm to self or others
- Breaking/throwing objects to intimidate

Rationale: Direct physical and sexual violations of personal boundaries.

5. Intimate Privacy Violations
- Shared intimate images without consent
- Threatens to show intimate images to others
- Extremely jealous/possessive
- Accuses of flirting/cheating

Rationale: Breaches of trust and personal boundaries in intimate relationships.

6. Positive Relational Characteristics (Contrast Group)
- Makes me feel comfortable and safe
- Loves me for who I am
- Respects my choices
- Understands my need for personal space
- Supports me in my activities
- Encourages trying new things
- Listens and shows interest when I want to share

Rationale: Represents healthy relational dynamics in contrast to abusive patterns.

This grouping reveals complex relational dynamics, highlighting systematic patterns of control, abuse, and boundary violation, contrasted with healthy relationship characteristics.
