### Key Observations:
1. **Coercive Control**: Dropped IT11, IT15 (revise), IT20, IT21, IT22, IT12 (redundant/weak fit). Retained financial/social control items (IT25, IT26, IT46, IT48).
2. **Emotional Abuse**: All items retained except IT13 (revise for clarity). IT20/IT21/IT22 moved here from Coercive Control.
3. **Threats/Intimidation**: All items retained; high severity and uniqueness.
4. **Physical/Sexual Coercion**: Both items retained; no redundancy.
5. **Fear/Trauma**: Dropped IT18 (overlap with IT28). Retained anticipatory (IT43) and chronic (IT28) fear.
6. **External Validation**: Dropped IT09 (IT19 is broader).
7. **Healthy Dynamics**: Dropped IT05 (overlap with IT04). Retained all others for contrast.
