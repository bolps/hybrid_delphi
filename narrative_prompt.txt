You are filling a boolean questionnaire for one Reddit narrative.

LABELING POLICY:
- Use common-sense inference and paraphrases. If the item is clearly implied, mark True.
- True → narrative supports the item (explicitly OR implicitly).
- False → narrative contradicts it OR provides no reasonable support.
- Evidence: give a short snippet (quote or paraphrase). If False due to no support, write:
  "No supporting evidence in the narrative".

QUESTIONNAIRE ITEM (Italian):
{item_id}: {item_text}
DIMENSION: {dimension_text}

NARRATIVE:
"""
{narrative}
