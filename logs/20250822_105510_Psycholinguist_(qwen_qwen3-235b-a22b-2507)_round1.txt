### Latent Dimensions Analysis  

Based on semantic similarity and latent linguistic meaning, the items were grouped into **five non-overlapping, homogeneous dimensions** reflecting core constructs of coercive and abusive dynamics in relationships. Each dimension was derived through rigorous clustering of shared semantic themes (e.g., control tactics, emotional manipulation, threat patterns), avoiding heterogeneity and ensuring all items were assigned without modification.

#### **1. Coercive Control**  
**Items:**  
7, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, 30, 31, 33, 35, 37, 38, 39, 42, 45, 48  
**Rationale:**  
This dimension captures *systematic domination through restriction of autonomy, social isolation, and resource monitoring*. Items reflect behaviors aimed at eroding the victim’s independence: controlling social interactions (e.g., forbidding contact with family/friends [20, 31], discrediting support networks [17]), regulating personal agency (e.g., dictating appearance [30], time management [22, 24]), and financial subjugation (e.g., restricting job access [37], monitoring spending [39, 42]). The inclusion of external concern (e.g., "friends/family are worried" [38, 48]) aligns semantically, as it signals the *observable severity* of control tactics. Crucially, all items emphasize the abuser’s *active imposition of boundaries* rather than passive neglect, distinguishing this from emotional abuse.

#### **2. Psychological Abuse**  
**Items:**  
1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 19, 23, 26, 29, 32, 34, 40, 41, 46, 49  
**Rationale:**  
This dimension centers on *emotional degradation, gaslighting, and relational sabotage*. Items describe patterns that systematically undermine self-worth and reality perception: public humiliation [1], silent treatment [5], blame-shifting [13], and invalidation of experiences (e.g., "he doesn’t listen" [46], "I hide discomfort for fear" [6]). Critically, these items share a *relational focus*—targeting the victim’s internal state through criticism [11, 14], emotional neglect [12, 19], and induced fear [26, 29, 40]. Mood swings [41] and conflict avoidance [23] further reflect *unpredictability* as a tool for psychological destabilization. Unlike coercive control, this dimension emphasizes *verbal/emotional tactics* without explicit physical or financial domination.  

---

#### **3. Threats and Intimidation**  
**Items:**  
25, 27, 28, 43, 44, 47  
**Rationale:**  
This dimension comprises *explicit threats and demonstrative acts of intimidation* designed to instill terror. Items share a *causal structure*: the abuser weaponizes fear through concrete consequences (e.g., "threatens self-harm" [25], "destroys property" [28, 44], "threatens harm to loved ones" [43]). Semantically, all items involve *conditional violence* ("if I leave, I’ll expose secrets" [47]) or *performative aggression* (object-throwing [28] as a warning). Notably, threats involving intimate imagery [27] are grouped here (not under sexual coercion) because their *function* is intimidation (e.g., "threatens to share images" [27]), distinct from direct sexual violation.  

---

#### **4. Sexual Coercion**  
**Items:**  
2, 10  
**Rationale:**  
This dimension isolates *violations of sexual consent and bodily autonomy*. Both items describe *direct transgressions*: non-consensual sharing of intimate imagery [2] and persistent pressure for sex despite refusal [10]. Semantically, they uniquely focus on *sexual boundary violations* as ends in themselves (not tools for broader control, as in threats [27]). The brevity of this dimension reflects the specificity of sexual coercion—it lacks overlap with psychological abuse (e.g., no gaslighting) or physical violence (e.g., no assault [36]).  

---

#### **5. Physical Violence**  
**Items:**  
36  
**Rationale:**  
This dimension encompasses *overt physical aggression*, represented solely by item 36 ("grabs hair, chokes, punches"). It is intentionally narrow, as physical violence here denotes *direct bodily harm* (distinct from intimidation via property destruction [28]). The isolation of this item underscores its semantic uniqueness: while threats [28, 44] *simulate* physical harm, this item describes *actualized violence*. No other items reference physical force, avoiding conflation with emotional or coercive tactics.  

---

### Key Observations  
- **Non-overlap ensured**: Coercive control (autonomy restriction) vs. psychological abuse (emotional harm) avoids conflating *behavioral control* with *affective manipulation*. Threats (instrumental fear) are separated from sexual coercion (bodily violation).  
- **Semantic precision**: Items like "threatens to share intimate images" [27] were assigned to threats (intimidation function) rather than sexual coercion (direct violation), per linguistic context.  
- **Theoretical alignment**: Dimensions map to established frameworks (e.g., Stark’s coercive control theory, psychological abuse typologies), but groupings derive strictly from item semantics—not pre-existing models.  
- **External validation items [38, 48]** were integrated into coercive control, as they semantically reflect *consequences of observable control* (e.g., "family worries" signals successful isolation).  

This structure reveals how latent dimensions operate synergistically: coercive control enables psychological abuse, which is reinforced by threats, while sexual/physical violence represent escalation points. Each dimension is lexically and functionally distinct, reflecting core mechanisms of abusive relationship dynamics.
