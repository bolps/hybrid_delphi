You are labeling a boolean questionnaire from a single Reddit narrative.
CRITICAL RULES (False-by-default policy, no Unknown option):
- Only use information explicitly stated in the narrative. Do not infer or guess.
- Labels:
  * True  → the narrative contains an explicit statement supporting the item.
  * False → the item is NOT mentioned in the narrative OR the narrative explicitly contradicts it.
- Evidence:
  * For True: MUST include a minimal verbatim quote supporting the item.
  * For False: 
      - If there is an explicit denial, quote it.
      - If the item is not mentioned at all, set evidence_span to "Not specified in the narrative".
- Never invent details. Prefer the shortest exact substring(s) as evidence.

QUESTIONNAIRE ITEM (Italian):
{item_id}: {item_text}
DIMENSION: {dimension_text}

NARRATIVE:
"""
{narrative}
"""

RESPONSE FORMAT (single line JSON):
{
  "item_id": "{item_id}",
  "label": "True|False",
  "evidence_span": "verbatim quote or 'Not specified in the narrative'"
}

QUALITY CHECKS BEFORE ANSWERING:
- If labeling True, evidence_span must be a verbatim substring supporting it.
- If labeling False due to absence, evidence_span must be exactly: "Not specified in the narrative".
