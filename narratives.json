    "text": "I'm F35 and my M31 boyfriend (been together for almost 2 years) took a \\\"break\\\" in December due to our arguments and lack of positive communication. During that time we didn't see each other as often at all. Prior to this break we had never gone a night without each other. However we still talked pretty regularly even if the conversations weren't always pleasant. One day we'd get along pretty well and then 2 days later we'd be back to arguing in circles about the same situations. We had both agreed that we wanted to work on things and be with each other. He would tell me he loved me and missed me and would say that I'm the one. However at the end of March I found out that he had been seeing and sleeping with a 28F for the whole \\\"break\\\" all while occasionally seeing me and sleeping with me. I saw the texts messsges between them and he was telling her he loved her and very emotional and meaningful texts at times. He told me she was just a fuck but if she was just a fuck then why so many compliments and the \\\"I love you\\\"?! I also found him sending women dick pictures and videos of him jacking off on Snapchat and he also messaged women and called women on Facebook. He emotionally and physically cheated on me. He downplayed the relationship with the 28F. They talked on a regular basis and hung out most everyday and she would stay with him. He says that he's \\\" in love\\\" with me and doesn't have any feelings for her. I just don't know what to believe because some of the stuff he texted her was exactly the same stuff he had sent me. I feel broken and insecure now. The amount of women and dirty things I saw was seriously unbelievable. I did not ever think he would do this to me. I didn't do anything to that extreme while on our break. I got a few phone numbers. I was asked out on a date and declined. I never emotionally or physically cheated on him at all. Also all of his family and friends knew about this woman and others. So now I feel uncomfortable and stupid around them. How would you feel? What would you do? I really am in love with him but I don't know how to feel.",

    "text": "I (35M) have been dating my girlfriend (27F) for a while now, and lately I feel like I'm constantly walking on eggshells around her. One of the recurring issues is how she treats my sense of humor. My friends and family tell me I'm funny, and I've always been able to make people laugh. But with her, if I laugh at something while we're talking, she'll stop and ask, \\\"Why is that funny?\\\" I usually apologize, but then she just won't continue her story. It makes conversations tense and awkward. There's also a pattern of her getting upset over small things. If I leave my shoes out, she screams at me. If I put her clothes away in the \\\"wrong\\\" place, she yells at me. What makes this harder is that she's currently not working, and I'm the one paying all the bills. I don't mind supporting her, but I feel like my efforts aren't being appreciated—instead I'm criticized or snapped at over minor things. I'm starting to question if this is just normal relationship stress or if I'm being treated unfairly. Has anyone been through something like this? How do you even start addressing it? TL;DR: 35M paying all the bills while 27F girlfriend isn't working. She often yells at me for small things (like leaving shoes out or putting clothes in the wrong place) and makes conversations tense by criticizing my sense of humor. Feeling unappreciated and wondering how to address this dynamic.",

    "text": "(TW! S*x and manipulative behavior) While I was in a relationship with my bf of 1,5 years. He continued to being manipulative and made me feel bad about my choices. He made me feel bad if I told him I didn't want to continue on with having s*x with him. So he kinda threatened me that he will get mad at me if I told him to stop. When we were having our 'sessions' he would force my head down onto the bed and slap me really aggressively on my behind. He made me feel like a disgusting person who was unable to please him. He never made any effort into making me finish either, he said that it's not important for me to finish. I never felt that blissful feeling afterwards, I just felt used and dirty.",

    "text": "I'm 18 now but this whole thing has stuck with me for a while. (Long story btw) I was F(15) and my boyfriend was M(17) and when we first got together everything was really good at first. We spent every day together, laughed together, caller every day. Like it was perfect. Maybe 4 months into the relationship his true colors started to slip. He would get drunk every night, get in fights with anyone, and he was addicted to weed. This was my first time having someone in my life like this so I didn't know what to do so I never said anything. Until, one night I was in my room watching youtube when he called me screaming at him saying i'm a whore and i'm cheating on him. I was trying to get him to talk to me 'like what are you talking about' he repeated I was a cheating whore. I finally got him to answer me and he was like I logged into your snapchat and saw a boy snapped you.(I never gave him my login info...) I told you to block every guy you had on snap! I tried to explain that the guy who had snapped me was my cousin but he wasn't having it. I got overwhelmed and started crying and he hung up on me. The next morning he texted me as if nothing had happened. I didn't say anything and acted like everything was fine. But then it got to the fact that we had gotten into a fight every day. I started to record every encounter I had with him during these drunken arguments to keep record incase anything happened. I told him that I thought we needed a break and he agreed as long as I would call him every night just to chat and keep up with each-other's lives. I agreed as long as he would stop drinking so much and smoking so much. He agreed as well. Then came him birthday... I was on the phone with him listening to him and his 2 best friends planning what they were gonna do for his early birthday party. One friend asked him \\\"Is she coming\\\" I figured he was asking about me but then my boyfriend muted his phone for a good while. I didn't ask anything for a little bit but when he didn't un mute for 2 hours I texted him. 'Hey love, i'm sorry to assume but I heard (his friend's name) ask if she is coming. I'm not sure if he is talking about me but i'm not coming since we are still on break and I want you to have a fun birthday' he responded \\\"I wasn't gonna invite you cause we are gonna be drinking and shit. And it's only us dudes\\\" I then said \\\"Oh okay that's fine. Who is she that he is talking about?\\\" He stopped texting and hung up. So I just went to bed. He didn't text me at all the next day or the night of his party. I texted \\\"Hi love, hope you are having fun. I'm going to bed good night\\\" no response. Then I wake up to him calling me drunk as heck. He kept saying he was sorry and he loved me and he missed me. Then he hung up. I ended up texting his friend 'Hey is everything okay with (boyfriends name) he called me and it seemed like something was wrong' His friend told me that my boyfriend had gotten coupled up with a girl from his school, and they ended up making out. I was hurt but me and him were on a break so I couldn't really be mad (Ik it's dumb to say that but I was young) I said \\\"oh... thanks, good night\\\" then over the next couple of days his drinking problems had come back so I asked him to cut down a little bit and he agreed to stop drinking completely. After a couple more weeks me and my boyfriend had been pretty steady and he said he wanted to get back together and I agreed as long as we would talk about how we feel and stuff regularly and stopped keeping stuff from each other. He agreed and we were pretty good for a while. Then his actual birthday came around and he stopped texting me for days again. I called him after 3 days of no contact asking what is going on with him and why I ghosted me. He told me he was staying with him mom and wanted to spend time with family and I said I understood and I was sorry and he said 'it's okay me and my mom are out shopping right now and we are gonna go to dinner. I love you, call you when I get home.' Then he hung up and didn't call or text for a couple days. The he got back home and called me drunk in the middle of the night trying to get me to come over to 'do the deed' I said I wasn't ready and asked him how was going to his moms... he laughed and said 'what the hell are you talking about I never went to my my moms. I was staying with (girls name from party) all week.' I said 'who is that?' He told me the girl he got coupled up with the from his party. I said 'oh...' and hung up. You tried text me for multiple days and I texted him I needed time to gather my thoughts. He kept asking me why and what I was thinking about. After a week I finally texted him that we needed to talk. He said okay I will call you tonight i'm with my friend right now. I said '(girls name from the party) that is what I needed to talk about' he stopped texting and he called me later that night. I said I wasn't talking to him if he was drunk. He said he was sober for a couple days since I stopped texting him. I then asked him 'Did you go to your moms for your birthday' he said 'Yes' I said 'Please tell me the truth' he sighed and came clean about staying with the girl from the party I asked him why and he told me he was trying to make amends with everyone he had hurt because of his drinking. I asked him 'did you f- her' he sighed and told me he did at the party but that was it. I questioned him about his drinking and other things he didn't remember from being drunk. I ended up telling him I wanted to break up because he still had some things he needed to work through. He said he understood and said I could talk to him whenever. I said Thanks and ended it there. Fast forward maybe 4 months and he texted me asking how I was and if we could catch up. I agreed. He kept saying he had been sober ever since we broke up. He changed a lot of things about how he was living for me and he wanted me back and he was sorry. I told him I missed him too and stupidly got back with him. Weeks go by and we were fine. He hacked into my snap chat once again and found some texts with a friend (who was a boy I had been friends with for years) talking about my SA story, my friend was consoling me. My boyfriend got drunk once again FaceTimed me and went off on me calling me a cheating whore once again. I was a whore for not keeping my legs closed and I let him happen to myself cause I liked the attention. He then went on about how I didn't love him and it was better if he was dead I started to cry and texted his friend to go check on him. My boyfriend went off on me even more mad yelling at me to turn my camera back on or how would sh--t himself. The he grabbed a rifle and pointed it at himself. I texted his friend to hurry up and call the cops while I tried to calm him down. His friend got there a few minutes later and they started fist fighting over the rifle. His friend took the rifle and threw it outside in a field. I turned my camera off again cause I couldn't stop crying and he told to turn it back on before he came to my house and beat the crap out of me till i'm almost dead and make me watch him sh--t himself while I slowly die alone. His friend started screaming at him not to talk to me like that. Then my boyfriend started screaming at his friend and me accusing us of sleeping together behind his back (which was not true) then my boyfriend swung on his friend and his friend started to fight him and ended up knocking him out cold. I got on my bike and road to his house and helped his friend clean up all the mess and help him into bed. The next day when he sobered up he asked me what happened and why I was sleeping on his couch and his friend was asleep on the floor. I told him I was gonna let his friend explain that to him and I kissed him goodbye and left. He called me after everything was explained saying he was sorry and he wasn't gonna drink again. I told him I was tired of his lies and promises and I think it was best if we broke up and let each other go. He started crying and I told him I knew he was cheating on me because I found his girlfriend's tiktok account full of videos of them together. And I didn't feel safe or respected in this relationship. He apologized and said he understood. I thought it was over but then he started stalking me so I told his girlfriend what was going on and that I was the 'other woman' and everything he has done to me. She went off on me and then him and he ended up calling me a million times and texted me I ruined his life and he was gonna make me regret what I did. I blocked him and went on with my life while his went to shit😂",

    "text": "I'm struggling to break up with him. I just got out of a really painful breakup and it took about 6 months or more till we got together. The happy memories are piercing my heart. We've made beautiful memories recently and I find it more difficult or almost impossible to say goodbye because of how special it felt. But then I remember the disrespect, the verbal and emotional abuse, how he always degrades me and calls me too sensitive while he always pointed out my flaws.. I'm exhausted but I still struggle to even visualize not having him in my life. He had been part of my huge milestones, he had seen me at my lowest. He's kind to me at times, but he's also mean. He's way too controlling yet he keeps denying that. I don't feel like I'm living my life, he judges my character every single time. I try to communicate, my emotions are dismissed. He's a massive perfectionist, I'm not perfect. He's impatient, I take time to work on my flaws. Has anybody experienced coming out from a dynamic like this? How did you do it and how did it go? I really wish we could make it work but I feel that he only believes what he thinks is right. I feel that he wants to manage the relationship the way he wants it to be.....I don't want another heartbreak... but I feel that maybe this relationship is just hopeless when he looks down on me so much.............",

He has my nudes, my face isn't in it, although I know he is not stupid to share them, I'm still worried he will have them. I need to get to his phone to delete them and anywhere he has them saved. I have the chance on Aug 18th to delete them from his phone, as I will be meeting him then since he will be helping me move to my dorm. Or I wait and act like everything is okay, and do it on September 1st when college starts. I sort of just want to do it as soon as I can because I do not want him to be part of a memory in my dorm, but again it's not reasonable to do it on the 18th as it will be one day and we are not sleeping over there (little opportunity to go on his phone and delete)",

    "text": "So my now ex-girlfriend & I had been in a relationship for over 6 months when this happened a few nights ago. Background: When I met her, I knew she was a stripper, she had s*x with people for $$$, and she went out with guys from the club for $$$. She seemed to detach the latter two parts of her life from our relationship fairly quickly. I was always good with her being a stripper, even supportive. While we've been together, she had the intent of having sex with one man in February, but it didn't happen—he ended up just eating her out. She did have sex with a regular for $$$ (she had sex with him for $$$ before we were ever together) a few weeks ago. Before it happened, she explained to me that he would not continue seeing her in the club if she didn't have sex with him. I put boundaries on it, asking her to not let him do certain things (let him eat her out, suck her tts, or kiss her) and he always wore a condom. I also told her I needed to be emotionally and sxually secure between us. She said he would not continue seeing her if she did not let him eat her out and suck her t*ts, but that she would respect me not wanting him to kiss her and my other requests (see attached). She went out with one guy back in April, but he ended up being crazy and after she wouldn't kiss him over a game, he got violent and threatening. She said then and there she wouldn't go out with anyone outside of the club, but that was not true. She has been out with one guy in particular a few times to this same nightclub. On top of this, this guy texts her in a romantic way (see attached). During our relationship, she lied to me several times. After getting back together after our first breakup (my initiation—I lied abt deleting old girlfriends text off my phone & deleting some old photos from before we were together), she lied to me about deleting texts off of her phone between her step-sister and an ex-boyfriend (I wasn't worried abt him, it was like middle school & she told him about our \"insane\" sex life). Apparently, the ex had come over to hang her TV @ her new apartment, but she had lied to me and said her dad did because she didn't want me to not understand. They talked about me and the breakup and how I was her \"slave\" and was \"obsessed with her\" and she couldn't understand the breakup. I confronted her and she upset with me that I had went thru her iPad to see the messages, but she apologized and we moved on. About a week after that, her and her step-sister went out Memorial Day to a nightclub and she was in a promoters section. Context About a week before this, we were out at a bar & there was a girl (in the same profession as myself) that came up to my then-girlfriend to tell her how attractive she is. They started talking & that's how she found out we were in the same profession. Then me & girl started talking—nothing flirtatious—just legal jargon—my then-girlfriend got upset, went to the bathroom, & came back to the girl putting her phone number in my phone (her request, not mine) for business connection. We left after the conversation went on for 'far too long\" & got into an argument, including about the phone number. Now she is in a promoters section, I tell her that is disrespectful to me to be around other guys and talking to them, considering it is not right for me to be around other girls and talking to them. She says \"promoters invite attractive girls to make themselves look better\". I get mad, go to the nightclub, and once there see her talking intensely with this guy. She's laughing, smiling, and really drunk. I confront her in the club (public scene), her step-sister has got this \"oh shit\" look on her face, and they are like \"let's go\"… so we go outside, argue. I ask her if she has given any guys her Instagram. She says emphatically \"NO\". I ask her is she has given any guys her phone number. She says emphatically \"NO\". She says awful things to me. She breaks up with me, drives home drunk, and the next morning texts me a big long message about how she was sorry for what she said, but that I shouldn't have come, she wasn't lying about where she was or what she was doing, and I don't trust her. Come to find out, she gave her Instagram out (because I would flip out whether she told me the truth or lied), and eventually I find out she gave her phone number out, but she blocked him after FaceTiming him the day after. We finally talk after days of arguing and she says I'll think about getting back together… she gets drunk that night out with a friend, calls me at 2:45 AM, and asks me to come get her. She said she wouldn't ever lie to me again… she's learned her lesson about being dishonest. I told her I wouldn't ever do what I did again and come a place she was like that. This past Sunday morning, I was feeling kinda off after she told me she was going to meet the regular at this nightclub. The way she talked about it over the phone was off, plus she was drunk (I've had to pick her up many times from the club because she failed breathalyzer). When I knew she was about to leave the nightclub, I went & parked across from her car. I saw her & the guy hug & snapped a shot of it. She called me two (2) minutes later, told me she was leaving & said to come to her house (we had planned that). I asked her how it was & then asked her if she hugged him. She said \"no\" then she said \"I don't think so, no\". I said I just watched you hug him two (2) minutes ago. She got mad at me for showing up there, not that she lied, but that I caught her, and manipulated me and gaslit me into that she lied because she was \"drunk\" (see attached). I still came to her house because I was angry and wanted to talk, she was being mean and rude, calling me names, etc. (see attached). Once we got to her house, I talked to her at her car & asked for her phone. She was being mean & degrading, & reluctantly let me go through her phone. \"You're insecure\". I was not in a calm, rational mind. I was angry & felt betrayed & my trust shattered once again. It wasn't really the hug that bothered me, it was yet another lie. I never knew what truly happened when she was out with these guys, but I expected her to be honest about it. We get into a huge fight… I call her a prostitute, I tell her she never would've made good grades in her first semester of undergrad if I didn't do her political science coursework (I did her essays, exams, and discussion boards—\"too difficult\" for her and I have a poli sci degree), I called her a btch and a liar. I told her I was going to tell her mom about her having sx for $$$ (my ex did something similar to an ex boyfriend that cheated on her to his mom). I just totally felt betrayed and was angry. I could've handled the situation better that night—but I told her, she pushed me to the edge/limit & I finally broke. I've never acted like that before, ever. We talked a day or so later. She was out with a friend & some guys. She said the things I said were unforgivable & that I truly scared her with how I acted. She's acted like that to me before, but she said \"not to that extent [in words or actions]\" and \"I'm a girl\". I was in such a mix of emotions, I broke down, apologized for how I acted & said I didn't really mean the things I said, and begged for her back [because I truly did love her—not everything was always bad]. She basically said I had went too far, I scared her with my actions, and I wasn't secure enough to be with her. The next morning, I woke up with a clear head, talked to a counselor/therapist, realized some things, and sent her some long messages (see attached). Could anyone handle all this?To add: I did pretty much everything for her (was her \"slave\"—her words). Cleaned her room, made her bed, got her stuff she wanted, took her places, got her from work and took her back, gave her $$$ for things, paid her car payment when things were slow at work (3 times), helped her through her first semester of undergrad… but more than that, I gave her the emotional connection and support none of her exes ever gave her. I always showed up for her, even in her darkest days. I always tried to make her feel the best. She always said I was her rock, the one who could make her feel better. I was with her through all of her manic episodes, meanness, irritation, etc.",

    "text": "we've been together for close to 3 years, but i hope this entry today marks the end of our relationship . I do not wish to go back to the relationship, and now that I'm given the chance to walk away I pray for the strength to leave and never go back. Ladies, if you are reading this, I hope you will never meet such man in your life. —— When I share simple day-to-day things or how I handle problems, if it doesn't align with his way of thinking or the original plan, he can flip out instantly—like a switch, turning into a batshit crazy maniac. For example, 1) Sharing a funny event that happened to me (I left my dildo in the bathroom and my brother saw it). 2) Sharing with him how I approached an issue by using a different method than usual. 3) We discussed an issue earlier, and I later shared my slightly different way of resolving it. The above simple daily situation turned him into a maniac. It was a life lesson for me when it comes to knowing someone anger management issues and their red flags . We always have to see things in their perspective, 100% of the time. To do things as similarly as or follow their way of logical thinking. Any form of deviation or inputs of your own opinion could possibly turn him into a maniac. When you have a different opinion from him they could turn the table and say \"why you they believe him, why you can't trust him, why you can't follow his instructions. It can turn him into a maniac You will find yourself being blamed for all bad things that happened between the both of you / happening to you . Their way of thinking is because you did this, that's why he it made him angry. If you do it, you deserve to be scolded / insulted / hit. you are always the cause of the problem, and hence these are the consequences. In their eyes, when his anger issue surfaces , you will always be blamed. You will always be labelled as the problem creator. He would question why you do things that way. Asking you \"Why… Why…Why..\" . But when i try to explain myself, he would most likely not accept it. Instead, my explanation would be deemed as arguing with him, he would nitpick my explaination as not logical, not accepting his way of thinking of doing things. Explaining myself and my situation would turn him into a maniac. They lack empathy do not and will not show understanding to yoursituation when you unintentionally stepped onto their triggers. You will get blamed for not remembering and keeping in mind the triggers that they have previously warned you about. They cannot understand or accept that when 2 different individuals have different ways of doing things / different thinkings. Basically, when you are in a relationship with such a person, you can't have your own opinion or thinking . You have to do things their way, based on their logical thinking. If you fail to do it, be prepared for them to turn into a maniac. He would have \"killer eyes\" look, there is no affection in their eyes . Only fire and fury. Their body will be extremely stiff and tense, both hands clutching into a fist. Always ready to strike, and trust me, they strike. when a man with anger management issues loses control and turn into a maniac, girl.. you better become a mouse and never a maniac along with them. They will be even more maniac . Never challenge them. A person with anger management issue have no boundaries and holds nothing back. they can take things to the extreme. They punch, they find things to throw and hit or to destroy. I have been hit by him, my property have been damaged by him. Ladies, if you ever find yourself in such violent situation, please remain calm, try to understand his perspective, agree to whatever he says. If he berates you, just agree with him that you are indeed an idiot. agree with him that you should have done things his way, and you are sorry for doing things your way. But make sure you genuinely understand from his pov. Appease him, to get yourself out safely out of the tense situation. Never challenge a batshit crazy maniac. I'm simply jotting down my experience as best as I could. Please feel free to share your encounters of people with anger management issues and how you manage to get out of the situation safely.",

    "text": "Hello Reddit, this is my first post and English isn't my first language, so apologies in advance if there are any errors. Please be kind. I, (35F) have been in a relationship with \"G\" (36M) for 4 years, and living together for 3. For the past several months I've started to notice more hostility in his interactions with me, that then tries to make it pass as a \"joke\". I'm neurodivergent (BPD), so my emotions are pretty intense. I go to therapy and take meds, but living with him isn't easy, I feel constantly triggered by his behaviour. He has ADHD but doesn't take medication or go to therapy at all, he thinks it doesn't work, \"because I'm still pretty fucked up\". Some context: Back in 2022 when we first moved in together, I was dealing with a severe burnout and he was unemployed, time when he did all the housework, and I would work around 12 hours daily. After a month or two, his mother had a bad fall and broke her hip, which caused him to spiral into depression. He gained a lot of weight and had little to no motivation. He spent most of his day sleeping and playing video games with his friends. I would try yo talk to him, but one of his friends complained about me doing so while they played so I started leaving him alone during those times. I also felt really alone. I fought hard to get out of my burnout,and yes, I wouldn't have the energy to cook or do laundry, but I tried my best. Ever since that happened, he will not stop telling me I'm lazy and that I never do anything around the house. It's funny because I've been doing 90% of the shopping, cooking, doing laundry, hanging and folding said clothes, doing the dishes, retrieving all packages, helping him with his work, taking out the trash, installing or repairing things at home, cleaning after him and taking care of the pets all by myself for the past 2.5 years. On December 2023, he asked me to marry him but I told him I wasn't ready, which he took as a complete no, and shut his emotions off. Ever since, he started making negative comments here and there, and now it's on a regular basis. From calling me \"dumbass\", \"fat\", \"slow\" or being bossed around because I forgot to do something (like sending a message on his behalf or not washing his pants). I honestly feel like a prisoner in my own home. We both work now and earn more less the same amount, he pays the rent and I pay all services (water, internet, electricity, etc), but I also do all of the housework, as mentioned above. I feel unappreciated and unloved, I'm constantly stressed and angry because all I hear are complaints about me but at the same time I if I don't do \"what I'm supposed to as a woman\" (his words, not mine and also \"a joke\") the criticism continues. Honestly, I'm just tired and sad. I love him, but I cannot picture myself living like this forever. It's exhausting. Still i haven't found the courage to call it quits. I feel like I don't have anywhere to go, or that I won't be able to make it on my own. Has anyone been on a similar situation? What did you do? Any advice will be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",

    "text": "Hi all, I could really use some guidance or shared experiences from anyone who's been through something similar. My (ex)partner and I were together for six years we built a life together: shared a home, pets, memories, dreams, and a truly deep bond. He's still my best friend in many ways. There was so much love not just romantic love, but real care, consideration, laughter, and shared pain. It wasn't perfect, but it was our little life we build together. We both had our struggles. I'm not here to paint myself as perfect far from it. During our relationship, I went through an incredibly difficult time with my mental health. I was eventually diagnosed with ADHD and autism, which explained a lot, but it doesn't excuse how reactive, intense, and at times even abusive I became. I was incredibly hard to live with. And I'm deeply ashamed of how I showed up during that period. I know I hurt him. I know I made things harder. And I carry that with me every single day. I don't take lightly the work I needed to do on myself. I've been actively working on myself for the past few years. I'm medicated now, I've matured, and I've taken time to reflect. Healing and change have to start with me, and I'm committed to that continued process. At the same time, i also endured multiple sudden bereavements, deeply painful ones. I didn't have the tools to cope, but through it all, he stood by me. I genuinely believe he held me up when I couldn't stand on my own. And I'll always be grateful for that. He truly always went above and beyond for me, supported all my interests and always made me feel safe. What I need to say, too, is that his drinking has been a problem for years long before the cheating, long before things fell apart. It was never just \"a phase.\" I tried so many times to talk to him about it gently, directly, lovingly but every time, I was shut down. Eventually it became frustrating, and seemed like it would never end. He told me I wasn't being supportive, or that I was nagging, or that I didn't understand. I tried to approach it from a place of concern, not judgment, but the wall always went up. It's also important to say that even before we met, he had an addictive personality and a tendency to distract and numb rather than confront difficult feelings. Over the years, I've watched him avoid emotional pain through alcohol, drugs, and video games. It's heartbreaking to witness, especially knowing the man he is underneath all of that. We've always struggled with communication. Whenever I tried to express how I felt, he often took it as criticism or an attack, even when I was trying to be open and vulnerable. And on the flip side, he often felt like I didn't listen to him. It became a painful cycle of miscommunication both of us feeling unheard, both of us shutting down. I don't think either of us wanted to hurt the other, we just didn't know how to meet each other where we were. We have both been under a lot of pressure this year, I have been in my final period my course and he is studying and working full time. I believe we've both lacked a lot of patience for each other recently. At the same time, he was carrying a lot too. He found himself under immense pressure during a really serious family crisis, and he never had much in the way of emotional support and even though I tried, I don't think I always knew how to support him in the best way, I truly am a bit of a yapper and tried to get him to talk about his feelings regarding this event but I think it done more harm and good. Eventually he started therapy which I was hopeful about but I think it opened up a lot of buried resentment toward me, I think it did help with his confidence and understanding of himself but, it seemed to make him more emotionally distant. Before the cheating, things had deteriorated between us. I was overwhelmed, emotionally intense, and not coping well. He had grown cold and withdrawn. I know I was difficult that week. And I fully take responsibility for the part I played in the breakdown of our relationship. Then one Sunday, he sent me a sweet message about how we'd be ok and we'd talk the next day and sort things out but he proceeded to drank heavily that night and cheated. I knew something was wrong my gut was telling me all night, but I genuinely thought it was maybe something had happened to him. I never thought in a million years he'd cheat. I mean it when I say I always trusted him, he's never ever given me a single reason to not trust him. He told me the second he got home, he honestly looked like he'd seen a ghost and was so shocked by his own actions, in floods of tears, said he was disgusted with himself, that it was the most regrettable and disgusting, disassociated experience of his life and that he left the situation immediately. He said the reason for this was he was in so much distress and wanted his life to end. We tried to rebuild for a short time, but he spiraled. The guilt consumed him. He couldn't sit with what he'd done. Eventually, he ended the relationship. He broke up with me in a text and moved out two months ago. He's barely faced me during this entire time and practically switched off to anything that might cause him discomfort. He told me he needed space to work on himself but from where I'm standing, that's not what's happening. He's drinking more, using coke, and spending nearly all his time gaming. His friends enable it, they know he can't stop once he starts drinking. His family downplays it. And I feel like I'm watching someone I love self-destruct while I'm helpless to stop it. Last weekend, he found out through a friend that I'd made a dating profile. He messaged me some petty messages but honestly after how distant he's been it was nice to even know he still cared. The truth? I only made it because I was lonely and feeling pretty down in the dumps. I had no intention of meeting anyone I just needed a distraction from the silence and the grief. I still love this man deeply, I never planned on rebounding or anything like that. Then, at 6am, he showed up at the door clearly drunk and high. He was in a terrible state. And all I wanted to do was help him. We talked. We reconnected. He told me he was still in love with me, was apologetic to a degree and i genuinely enjoyed seeing him (even in the state he was in) It felt raw, honest like there was still something real between us. But when I tried to share my pain, he got defensive. I've tried not to take that personally, but it's hard. It's exhausting to keep silencing my own emotions just to avoid pushing him further away. The next day, he was distant again. Cold. Shut down. Tonight, I forgot my flat keys and needed to borrow his. I offered to have them sent in a taxi, but he came in person. When I got emotional (our anniversary should have been this week) he completely shut down and was dismissive, honestly I'd say he was irritated I was crying. He packed the last of his things, and I was begging him to just stop for a moment to listen to me. No softness. No kindness. Before he left, I got frantic. I acted in a way I'm deeply ashamed of. I was overwhelmed and desperate all I wanted was for him to see how hurt I am. I'm embarrassed by how I acted, but I honestly believe it could have been avoided if he had just paused even for a moment to acknowledge my pain. If he had shown even a small moment of warmth or understanding, I don't think I would've overeacted like that. I feel like I'm always left looking crazy for being emotional about all this. Please don't tell me there's no hope. I'm scared for him I don't think he has any real support. I truly believe he's pushing me away because of guilt and shame and blaming all the problems in his life on our relationship, I still believe we love each other. That feels undeniable to me. We have literally been building a life together for over half a decade. I know I can't fix him. I know I can't save him. I know I can't enable him. But how do I stop caring? How do I step back from someone who once stood by me when I was falling apart, when I was at rock bottom. All I want to do is stand by him too. I'm trying to respect his need for space but it's so hard. Especially because he was the one who begged me to stay after the cheating. He asked for forgiveness, and I gave it. I stayed. I was ready to work through it together. To face all these challenges head on and completely start from the ground up. And then he walked away. He gave up. He blamed me. And now I'm the one left holding everything. He's recently admitted he's an addict. And I am proud of him for saying that out loud it's a huge step. But I don't trust that he's truly engaging in recovery. I don't know how to step back when I'm scared of what that road might look like for him. He says he still wants a future with me that one day, when we're both healed, we'll find our way back to each other. I want that too but it feels so open ended you know ? But right now, I don't know how to talk to him without being shut down, or triggering him, dismissed, or made to feel like I'm too much. I don't know how to hold onto hope without completely losing myself. He blocks and unblocks me, he doesn't check in on me, check on our cats or really consider anything at all. Please don't mistake this for delusion. I see the damage. I see the denial. I see the possibility of this never being fixable. But I also see the man I love the man who is sensitive, brilliant, funny, kind and in so much pain. And it's killing me to watch that version of him fade into someone I barely recognise. If anyone's been through something similar especially with a partner struggling with addiction i'd be really grateful to hear your perspective. I keep asking myself: do I need to fully let go and let him find his own way? Is there a way to offer love and support without losing myself without seeming desperate or endlessly available? My mind races constantly, wondering if he'll forget about me, even though deep down I know that's not true. I know he's hurting too maybe even more than I am. But what scares me most is that he's pushing all of it down, numbing himself, and that when it eventually rises to the surface, it might completely overwhelm him. I just want to know how to care for someone I love, without abandoning myself in the process. How to love someone from the sidelines when i know they're going down a dark path. I want to show up in a way that's compassionate but still self-respecting. Any advice or insight would mean the world right now. Thank you for reading :) x",

Recently (at least 5 months, however the friendship began a year ago), it has been feeling less like we are good friends and more like what everyone has been describing in here. I can't tell if it's a toxic relationship here or not. He has: 1) Gaslit me 2) Guilt-tripped me 3)Invalidated my thoughts and feelings 4) Humiliated me around friend. And now it feels like I'm walking on eggshells. I know that the list probably could be longer, I just don't feel confident that everything really connects to it being a toxic relationship. I'm probably just overreacting or seeing it wrong. Any comments would be helpful though!",

    "text": "I'll be referring to this person as Patrick. I hope redditers find this story insightful and helpful I've done my very best to put as much detail into the story as possible from memory. From beginning to end It is definitely the first time I've encountered somebody with severe narcissistic tendencies and maliciousness I've never seen before. NOTE! This story contains domestic violence abuse. Racism. homophobia. White supremacy And misogyny. I first met Patrick online. Initially, people were saying things like, \"Oh, you'd really like this guy. I think he lives near you. You guys should meet — you have similar interests.\" This went on for a few days. \"Have you met him yet?\" people would ask. There was some confusion over usernames, but eventually, I did stumble upon him. We got on very well. We started talking for weeks, eventually exchanging numbers. After a while, we decided to meet up. He would later tell me down the line. Inform me that I was completely different from all of his other friends I was unique he said totally different so much more fun\"your my best friend\" And I believed it because I was totally different from them. He came from a group of football hooligans and that type of crowd where drug taking was common. And there wasn't much emotion or intellectually stimulating conversations. I truly did believe that part. I'm a bisexual male I'm empathic and artistic And deep as a person. Of course I'm different to who he's been around. He said \"I really can be myself around you\" One thing that struck me as unusual was that, rather than meeting in a public place — which I would normally insist on — Patrick wanted to come directly to my home. Oddly, I felt okay with this. It's not something I would ever normally agree to, but I felt a strong connection with him. Before he arrived, though, there were red flags. On his drive over, he made a comment: \"You're not going to try it on with me, are you?\" I took it as a joke and laughed, replying, \"Absolutely not.\" At this point in our friendship, we weren't flirting or anything of that nature. But he kept repeating the comment as he got closer. It became irritating. When he arrived, I opened the door and there he was — a small guy with olive skin, dark brown hair, and bright sparkling blue eyes. He was undeniably good-looking. We got on very well. We didn't stay inside long; we went out almost immediately. We talked about art, politics, and more. I noticed something odd about his eyes. As we all know, when people drink, their pupils usually dilate — but his stayed unusually pinned. He made comments about my eyes too, saying they weren't as nice as his. I have blonde hair and blue eyes, and I replied teasingly, \"Mine are real. Yours look fake.\" He got defensive, insisting they were real. I didn't argue. I just let it go. Weeks later, he finally admitted he wore contact lenses and referred to his natural eyes as \"horrible brown.\" When I eventually saw his real eyes, I sensed deep insecurity. I comforted him, saying his natural eye color was very nice, and that it suited his olive skin and dark hair far more than blue eyes. He seemed to appreciate that. I was always comforting him telling him he was good looking. He knew he was good looking anyway but there was insecurity there And stupidly I didn't realize it but I was stroking his ego too much I was embolding him and his confidence. What's also, another thing to add is the fact that he would always open his camera on his phone and look at his face. He would always stare into his own reflection when passing windows And when at my house he would always stand longingly into the mirror for ages at himself Constantly checking his appearance I was under no illusion that he loved himself. I just didn't realize how narcissistic he actually was to turn out to be And clearly sociopathic. Heavily used words but in this case absolutely not. We continued going on nights out and getting along well. But one night, things changed. He felt distant. Cracks began to show, though I didn't know him well enough yet to understand what they meant. He was constantly, obsessively reminding me how straight he was and how much he loved women. He would often make overproved statements like \"love eatin pussy so much\" And often they felt very forced and pushed just like when he would also say\" I can't wait to have a wife and kids. I'm going to have so many kids \" but he would speak so demeaning of woman as well\" He often made demeaning or racist comments about people who weren't white. And on multiple occasions I had to be the wingman and introduce him to girls I was talking to because he would shy away. Then, one night, I turned around in a club after getting us drinks — and saw him making out with a gay man of Pakistani descent. I stood there frozen, confused. I asked him, somewhat jokingly, \"What on Earth is going on?\" He replied defensively, \"I thought it was a woman. I'm so drunk.\" But the man clearly looked like a man — not androgynous, not presenting as female. Just a gay man. Bearing in mind Patrick never shuts up about \"Jews non whites\" and how much he hates gay people despite his sister being a lesbian and he even says the most unthinkable things about her. But then he talks to her on video call and plans on doing a speech at her wedding, the irony. I said, \"Don't be ridiculous. Are you gay?\" He got defensive again. \"I'm not gay, I'm just drunk,\" he insisted. I reminded him, \"I thought you didn't like those people. Doesn't this go against everything you say — your Nazi views? The ones you never shut up about?\" He replied, \"Well, at least he's Persian.\" But I had already spoken to the guy and knew he was Pakistani. Not that it mattered, but the hypocrisy was glaring. And this wouldn't be the first or last time something like this happened. He would lay it on down the line admit to making out with multiple men. And maybe even more for all I know. He's also feticized Islam and the way they treat woman. Most of what he says leaves me deeply confused on the level of hypocrisy has no bounds. Later that night, Patrick stormed off with a girl who was friends with the Pakistani man. I didn't leave because his car was parked at my house and he had left the keys inside. I tried telling him, but he was dismissive. He actively tried to ditch me that night Leave me. And fundamentally that was definitely because I caught him in the act with the gay man.Eventually, I found him again and told him I didn't like how he kept trying to ditch me. We were supposed to be out together as friends. On the taxi ride home, he wouldn't speak to me. It was like I had seen something I wasn't supposed to. When we got inside, the atmosphere was tense. I said, \"If you want to talk, I'm here.\" He exploded into rage. I tried to calm him down. I told him he couldn't drive home drunk and that he should just sleep on the sofa. He responded by violently shaking me and throwing me to the ground before storming out and slamming the door. The next day, I was incredibly upset and confused. I woke up to a barrage of abusive messages from him. Things like, \"You think you're better than everyone,\" and so on. I responded, \"What on Earth are you talking about?\" He had really upset me. I finally snapped and said something like, \"I'm not the one pretending to be a white supremacist while also making out with men — and men of color, no less. You need to figure out what you are, because right now, you're just a giant hypocrite.\" That enraged him. He sent even more horrible messages. Then he created fake accounts to trick me into sending explicit images of myself. When I fell for it, he used those images as revenge porn — sending them to my friends, family members, and group chats. One of the nastiest things he did was he screenshotted an old old Facebook account. I had lingering that I'd forgotten about and he was gloating about it saying you didn't privatize your friends. And then proceeded to message them the nudes. He was partially successful, though my family's privacy settings and his lack of knowledge about their names made it harder for him. Still, he tried — and I later found out he had done this to others, too. It was a pattern of behavior. I contacted the police. They were initially helpful, but over time, they became less so. It took them ages to track him down, which prolonged the process. Eventually, I blocked him. Months passed without contact, and I started to forget about him. The police officer that did visit my home informed me that he is a lengthy history with sending indecent images and And has been in trouble before for malicious communications. But then I heard from a friend that Patrick had been posting my images everywhere he possibly could. It was even to people that barely knew me. One thing that was refreshing is many people seen through his disgusting act and said it was disgusting. Only proving my point Even worse, tho is that he tried hard and desperately to reach my immediate family, my mother, my father and my brothers to send them direct messages. He desperately tried to get that information but ultimately failed. This just proved to me the lengths he would actually go. He had also screenshotted and secretly recorded conversations when we were friends which was another strange and disturbing factor. I would later understand he was always building an arsenal of weapons to use against me. The whole time, he made me look like the aggressor, like the obsessed one. And people believed him — because Patrick was charming, good-looking, and persuasive. He could lie so easily, so convincingly. I don't think he had a conscience. From that one brief video call with his grandmother, I got the sense that she was nothing like what they described. She seemed gentle, soft-spoken, and completely undeserving of the venom they spat behind her back. It made me realize how easily Patrick and his mother could turn on anyone — how their cruelty didn't discriminate. No one was safe, not even family. They literally spoke of this woman as if she was the devil and both reveled in each other in the disgusting things they were saying about her. This is a member of his family who he lives with. I also found it strange because his Mum has a large house. So does his father.. but they don't want him around which is very telling. Despite how \"close\" they might be as he claims. If I was to put my hand on it I would say this scared and embarrassed of him and they keep a close relationship with him purely for peace but they would never dream of taking him back in. And his mother did show with me privately in a message That it has been a nightmare with him, whatever that means? After Patrick left my home, he stayed gone. But the ghosting, the random messages, and the psychological games didn't stop. Every now and then, he would resurface just to remind me of the emotional control he still tried to hold over me. Always being cold and distant hot and cold. I felt myself slipping into a strange, hollow state — confused, disoriented, questioning my own reality. The lines between friendship, manipulation, emotional abuse, and attraction had become completely blurred. I had tried to give him space, compassion, patience. But it became clearer each day: none of that mattered to him. His affection was conditional. His love if it could even be called that — was a performance. And beneath it all was someone deeply manipulative, deeply insecure, and dangerous. Somebody with severe identity issues. I began to think back on the things I had previously brushed aside. The way he bragged about emotionally destroying his ex-girlfriends. The way he laughed about ruining people's lives online. The way he lied so easily — about his eyes, his sexuality, his beliefs, even his own past. He would say how they made him these amazing meals how they cooked for him. But then within seconds would thrive off the fact that he choked them punched one of them in the stomach. He evenly openly expressed that \" women should be beat and not allowed to vote\" It was always hard to try and take pay things with a pinch of salt, but then you realized that he actually really meant these things. And then there was the physical violence. The night he shook me and threw me to the floor because I tried to keep him safe. That wasn't a loss of control — that was a warning sign. It wasn't just emotional abuse. It was physical, too. He only threw me to the floor that night because I was trying to stop him from drink, driving, endangering himself and others. What haunted me most were the subtle betrayals. The nights where he'd cuddle me, hold me, whisper kind things — only to turn around and twist the knife days later. The way he could be so affectionate and gentle, then so cold and calculated. It left me spiraling. I felt broken, ashamed, and isolated. But the most disturbing realization of all was this: He enjoyed it. He enjoyed the confusion. The control. The subtle cruelty. The power. There was a glint in his eye when he watched me stumble over my words, unsure of how to confront him. There was a smirk when I tried to explain how he hurt me. He would twist everything back onto me and leave me apologizing for things I didn't even do. He knew exactly what he was doing. Eventually, I stopped replying. I stopped trying to reach him, to understand him, to get closure. I realized I was never going to get any because he wasn't capable of giving it. And I stopped blaming myself. It was really hard because I'd actually really loved something that was fake. Something that wasn't true. It took time. A lot of time. I had to unlearn everything I believed about our connection. I had to remind myself that being empathetic and kind isn't weakness but allowing that kindness to be weaponized against you is dangerous. I kept thinking about the beginning how charming he was, how magnetic. But that charm was a mask. And once I saw behind it, once I truly understood who he was underneath it was terrifying. Patrick wasn't a misunderstood person in need of help. He was a cruel, manipulative abuser who preyed on compassion. He blurred lines, built trust, created dependency, then slowly dismantled the person in front of him piece by piece. He really loved to bring people down. Watch them suffer and he definitely got off on seeing peoples emotions collapse. I wasn't his first victim. And I'm scared I won't be his last unfortunately. I think at some points I've been hopeful that he might change, but I highly highly doubt that. And I'm almost 100% certain that he will be in a very tumultuous toxic relationship with a woman who he will absolutely destroy like the others. He speaks of woman is such strange and dangerous tones. Like the But I'm not ashamed anymore. I survived it. I lived through it. And I'm stronger for having walked away. Patrick is a predator who manipulates, abuses, and then paints himself as the victim. He uses charm, sex, art, pity, and rage to control others. His parents enable him. His patterns are not accidental — they are deliberate. If you've gone through something similar: You're not weak. You were groomed, targeted, and harmed. That's not your shame to carry. Patrick described himself as a neo-Nazi, but also engaged in homosexual behavior with men/men of color — often fetishizing them while still expressing racist ideology. He would call someone \"Persian\" to avoid saying they were Pakistani, trying to maintain the illusion of ethnic superiority. He also has and unhealthy creepy obsession with DNA ancestry phenotypes. Race purity. And womans rights He often spoke cruelly about his friends behind their backs, even while claiming he had a vibrant social circle just to spite me for having a smaller, close-knit one. He would speak highly of them but then call them degenerates. They have degenerate lifestyles. There's a girl you should meet my friend. \"She's really nice but a huge fat beast I kissed her once\" statements like these just led me to worry about what the kind of stuff he says about me behind my back which is evidently obvious. And while he was obsessed with \"clean eating\" and gym routines — a result of former body image issues — he remained unemployed and directionless, desperately clinging to control where he could get it. He sent me a very lengthy abusive message in retaliation to the message that I sent his parents which was very much so a polite message because I didn't want to just block them or remove them. The only thing that I put within that message was that he has hurt me and he needs help. And he's continued doing reckless acts. I informed them that he tried to send explicit images of me without consent \" revenge pornography\" and the drink driving That endangers his life and others. But I ultimately decided not to include as much detail of his abuse in the message to them due to my lack of trust in these people especially his mother. And she had to informed me that he has a history of this. And that she's very sorry. Whether that is indeed truthful I don't know. I don't really care now because I just once gotten with my life. I found his message to me. Quite funny actually how much he's got into detail about trying to undermine me as a person as well as the blatant personal attacks in that message, which I expected He's only proven how cold, evil and calculated and manipulative he is as an individual. \"Me and my father were laughing at your pathetic message in your feeble attempt to involve my family\" just lets me know everything about him even more because my message was sincere, polite and to the point it wasn't malice malicious or out of spite. I never even mentioned anything remotely to them about all of the other things he's done to safe him a fragment of dignity. I might even consider sharing his reply message because it is the most narcissistic piece of art I've ever seen and just how much he's informed his parents of a picture that he's painted of me as this obsessed, insane person who did multiple artistic pictures of him obsessed with him and wanted him And that he felt uncomfortable and had to flee the situation. There is giant holes in his narrative and I find it hilarious. He forgets that I have mountains of evidence and he has none. NOTE information I found useful when comparing his behavior and manipulation: - Psychological Manipulation & Narcissistic Behavior  Charm-Based Grooming: Initially came across as charismatic, intelligent, and deep — used shared interests (art, politics, etc.) to quickly build rapport and trust. - Love-Bombing Followed by Devaluation: Rapid closeness, followed by erratic coldness, degrading humor, and withdrawal of affection.- Hot & Cold Tactics: Switched between affection and cruelty to destabilize my emotions and control your responses. - Projection and Gaslighting: Repeatedly accused me of being obsessed, while he was the one reinitiating contact, asking to be drawn, and messaging cruel things after ghosting. - Control Through Confusion: Would say contradictory things, e.g. \"I'm straight\" while engaging in homosexual behaviors, or saying he wanted honesty then weaponizing my vulnerability. - Ego and Validation Dependency: Required constant control, admiration, and power treated people (including me) like tools to boost his self-image. - Mockery of Your Emotions: When i expressed emotional pain, he'd double down or dismiss it, saying your emotions \"don't matter to me at all.\" - Abusive Behavior (Emotional, Physical, and Sexual) - Revenge Porn: Tricked me into sending an explicit photo via fake account and attempted to distribute it to friends and family. - Physical Violence: Shoved me to the ground during a drunken rage and has a history of violence toward others (punching, chasing, hitting exes). - Verbal Abuse: Sent cruel and calculated messages targeting my appearance, family, finances, home, and even your cat. - Threats and Intimidation: Claimed he would physically attack me in past messages; invoked legal threats later to silence me. - Sexual Coercion and Boundary Blurring: Made inappropriate and manipulative sexual remarks like \"I could get you to buy me anything when you're horny.\" Shared a bed with me, cuddled me — then mocked that closeness later. He would constantly blur the lines even as far as giving me love bites. But I maintained and insisted. We are just friends. \"Best friends\" - Distorted Identity & Hypocrisy - Fake Eye Color Lie: Insisted his blue eyes were real (they weren't); became defensive and paranoid when you saw through it. This fed into a deep insecurity around identity and control. - Obsessive Focus on Race & Appearance: Fetishized blonde hair and blue eyes; obsessed over your \"phenotype\" while expressing neo-Nazi ideology. Contradicted this by engaging sexually with men of color and excusing it with bizarre justifications (e.g., \"at least he's Persian\"). - Racist & Misogynistic Views: Repeatedly made demeaning comments about women and non-white people. Claimed he hated \"those types\" but sought them out sexually and socially. He would constantly speak of people as subhuman filth And overly obsess over phenotypes DNA and ancestral Heritage - Self-Proclaimed Neo-Nazi: Couldn't go a day without referencing Nazis or Aryanism. These beliefs seemed more about identity inflation than actual conviction — a twisted form of self-mythologizing. It became so frequent and annoying that one day I did snap and I said can you just go a minute without mentioning anything to do with that.

    "text": "I need some relationship advice… 22/F & my bf 23/M have been living together since i found out i was pregnant(i had a miscarriage back in april) but we've been living together since February of this year and we will hit 2 years in August. Anyways, last night we went to the fast station cause he wanted get some gas. when we had arrived he asked me if i wanted anything. i told him \"yeah, let me just get a dr.pepper\" which then he said \"nah, im looking out for your health and sodas are unhealthy.\" it's not like i drink sodas everyday, but im on my period which i know isn't an excuse but my hormones are still unbalanced from dealing with postpartum depression and being on my period. Anyways, i told him \"well what's the point of asking me if you're just gon tell me what i should i get.\" he wanted me to get those aloe drinks which have HELLA sugar in them like i know sodas are worst but aloe drinks aren't healthy either just cause they say aloe on it. he proceeded to call me in the gas station and ask me what i wanted and that im taking forever to decide even though i told him what i wanted. i ended up hanging up on him and telling him just get whatever. in the ride home he told me i was being childish and i had the worst attitude all because i told him what i wanted and he wasn't happy with that. he told me that i need to start controlling my cravings and have self control. MIND YOU. he smokes POT every single day. he quit for like a week and that same night ended up getting some more but ME. i can't control my cravings. so i told him ok im not tryna go back and forth. so when we got home we didn't talk much and just was quiet. i ended up making myself a sandwich( i know it's random but there's a reason why im saying this). Two hours i came to him told him that he was doing too much. he apologized and we were doing fine. Fast forward to it being like 2am, he was trying to go back out to pick up some \"pot\" from his plug and told me that he was going to bring me a dr pepper. which in my mind i'm like yay. he's actually putting his pride to the side and not doing too much.(before he left he was trying to get his meat suck but i told him nah cause it's late. i'm exhausted and im just not up for it) When he came back he came back with two muffins for himself and told me he didn't bring me a dr pepper cause i didn't make him a sandwich earlier when we wasn't talking and that i didn't care to ask him if he was hungry and i didn't care bout his needs and im being self centered and only thinking bout myself. My whole thing was that if he was hungry he could've asked me but im not making him no sandwich if you want to be a dick to me for no reason. he then proceeded to go to the other room (which is out office room) and lock the door on me to roll up by himself. i'm not much of a smoker but since we lost our son i've been smoking to help cope which i recently just quit) Anyhows, i banged on the door cause i got triggered which i know was wrong of me but it's cause im traumatized. the whole month of june he was micro cheating (paying for onlyfan subscription, and on telegram paying 30 dollars for nudes) so yes i banged on the door cause i was worried and even though deep down i feel like he learned his lesson. i don't trust him and he did that shit after i gave birth to our stillborn like how am i supposed to feel. he opened the door and told me that he wanted to be left alone. so i said \"ok\". i grabbed his keys and just sat in his car and cried my ass off. n then texted him (ill send screenshots cause guidelines are gay) Now fast forward til today, he's back to being \"nice\". i haven't said anything but \"morning\" and that your \"dinner is ready\". i'm so drained and tired of trying to communicate but he turns it into me trying to be toxic. am i? should i mention he pays for all the bills and i cook, clean, his laundry, take care of the cat by myself, have to take care of his sexual needs. which i have no problem but he doesn't even give me any attention. he sits on his laptop and watches twitch. watching other people live their lives, if he's not doing that he's sports betting or taking a nap which i get cause he works but i work part time, and being a stay at home gf is damn near a whole 24/7 job no days off. all i ever is for attention and instead he stresses me out. should i just shut up and listen to him. maybe we won't have problems. am i the problem or toxic? like what is it in doing wrong.",

    "text": "Broke up this morning. It's hard because I do love him but I had to break up with him this morning, over what happened last night. He is going through a lot with his ex and not being able to see his daughter so he's been drinking a lot more and getting really sad and angry, I don't blame him for being upset over not seeing his daughter I'm upset that I couldn't get to see her either but the way he was handling was not healthy. Few months ago he got angry, I was trying to tell him to calm down and I tried leaving him alone to not get in a argument because how Mad he was, but he got in my face shoved me around I told him I'm going to call his mom (I didn't know what to do, I've never been in a relationship like this before) then l went into the bedroom and lock the door, he kick the door in he took my phone away I tried getting it back he went outside trying to smash it I was able to get it back after he went outside, I was able to lock him out after. After a while he calmed down and he said did you really lock me out why did you lock me out I'm sorry I love you so much after a while I caved and let him back in and the rest of the night was fine very stupid of me. Since then he calls me little girl in a mature irresponsible even though I pay my rent I take care of myself and my car he likes to put me down and then little arguments here and there. Last night he was drinking and he looked like he was getting upset and he was messaging somebody I didn't know who so I just left him alone and he was starting to get irritable so I got a little nervous and lock the door maybe I shouldn't have done that That's when he started getting more angry when he noticed I did that he said oh really Lock the f****** door so I said I'm sorry I unlock the door and then it was quiet then all of a sudden it erupted The insults came back I told him to knock it off why you acting this way I've tried so hard working with you in this relationship and you act like this and he's like oh yeah he then said I need you to get out of my f****** face now I told him but I'm not in your face I'm trying to talk to you and I have yet to raise my voice at him. then he got in my face started raising his hands I got nervous he said I could just punch you right in the f****** face I told him not to and he shoved me got up in my face again I wanted him to get away so I pushed him and I tried walking away and he thought I was going to call his mom I tried locking the door but he kicked it open out of my hands he shoved me to the ground I hit my back on the bed frame took my phone. I needed my phone back and so I tried grabbing it I tried holding on to him just enough to grab my phone and run off I tried calling somebody but nobody answered. He shoved me to the ground again I laid on the ground crying after he finished screaming at me more he walked off(I have a weird stress bleeding with my nose so blood is just everywhere) he came back into the bedroom and he saw the mess started crying and saying I'm so sorry I'm so sorry I should just RIP and I said don't do that there's no need but I just need you to leave me alone I told him over and over again then he like walked off after a while of begging and I went to the bathroom to try to clean myself up I heard my keys jingle I didn't think about it at all and he took my car I called the police he came back a little bit before they arrived he was in the back room doing something I don't know what and I was talking to the officer they thought he broke my nose I told him no he didn't in the officer got annoyed and said you're just trying to help him out I'm like no this is a normal bleeding thing when it comes to dry air or stress and he laughed and said dry air so EMS came told them no like I said to them but while I was talking to one officer he decided to run punching officer then got put in the car and he started either head banging or kicking the door. This morning went through his phone to see what made him so agitated not just over his custody situation and I found some people that were stuff sellers and I was curious about what he was doing in the the back room last night (That room is his room with his tools and all and I have my room for my collection so I left his room alone I trusted him) I found these glass looking white stuff I've never seen it in my life I called my dad and he told me do not touch it apparently he started using recently I didnt know. So he took my car to do a pickup basically. I don't know how to feel I don't have a lot of friends not really a lot of people to talk to I'm going to try to go to the gym just to distract myself but I feel very empty and alone. I just don't want to be alone when the relationship looks good it was awesome and when it was bad it was bad. I'm sorry for the long post thing I just don't know the steps to feel better and move on and if I did the right thing by calling",

    "text": "Hello, i am in a relationship with a Male, the start of our relationship was lovely, we were lovely to each other, compliments, 24/7 texting, and i was so in love, but he, on other side used that, he made me cry, he was making me insecure, making me feel like i have to change myself for him, which i did, but i regret everything that i have changed, my health problems went up, my appearance is not as pretty as it was before we got together, in short, he ruined me, and then said it himself, that he liked me more in the start of the relationship, i have went through such mental rollercoasters, also we are long distance if thats important. One day i had enough, i started to open my eyes and see that everything that i am doing \"for him\" makes me feel lower, unhappy, trapped, i started to live my life, stop being bothered by his everyday stupid jokes and comments and slurs he is calling me (those are apparently his jokes and a way to show love?!??) And it was nice for a while, i felt nice, even thought we are good, we trust eachother, im not angry he is not angry, but then, i guess he got tired of the calmness, he started to get so mad for nothing, started to spam my phone with slurs bc i was out with my girls and i even update him every minute, but still, he wants something small to be something big, i even feel like he wants me to cheat, so he is right and he can prove that i am a monster, he is saying to me i cheat, i cheat with multiple people, that im a slut…i could go on, but then when he tells me that he loves me, i cant say it back, i dont feel loved, i feel abused, i feel like in the future it will get worse, i feel like he feeds off of me having mental breakdowns, me crying, he enjoys my pain, he feels powerfull, i dont know how to change this person he is, i tried to love bomb him for him to know and feel loved, i tried to be sweet, but he gets tired of everything, i don't want to leave him, ofc everyone who knows about how he acts says to me to run, to just run away, and i know that its the right thing to do, but im just too much of an coward i guess to just leave, he makes me stress everyday, with him being angry it makes me stress, spam calls spam texts slurs, everything is so overwhelming, there are days i just feel like this is the end for me that everything is too much i just want to disappear, so i dont even have to deal with leaving him do i dont even have to explain why i am leaving him, ghosting him recently has been my everyday thought. I think he just sees that i can live without him, have fun without him and on top of that i can look good, and it brings him some kind of insecurity, he is scared i will cheat or do something i dont even know, i dont even know what i am typing im just breaking down atp",

    "text": "Pls Note: This will be a long SPECIFIC READ, but all details contribute to our relationship issues, which is why I mentioned all of it. I want to start this by saying 30F my bf 32M grew up in prison. Literally. Many years at that, over 10 years. I feel this is important to note because it explains (at least to me) most of our problems. He isn't a bad person overall, but this has become toxic. So 1st off, he is a good man. Funny, sweet most times and I used to feel very loved by him. But recently we've been fighting nonstop. And I want to know if I'm valid in the way I feel, as well as advice, because I don't want to break up, because I know for a fact he isn't cheating or even interacting with anyone else. Which is very important to me. So we have been living together for 6 months, I own my home, and when we argue he always leaves. Packs all his things, just to beg to come back hours later. It's a waste of energy and I asked him to stop but he continues to do it. It got to a point were he would promise me he'd never do that again, \"no more leaving\" etc (I have abandonment issues, so when I feel rejected I close off and go numb) but he still continues to break promises and leave again. I don't contact him whatsoever when he leaves, he always does. Almost like he expects me to chase but sees once I won't, he comes back in and starts trying to fight for us. He often admits he's wrong after arguments. Recently he bullies me and hurts my feelings. I tell him this. He uses finances against me, as I don't work, (yes I know, but it's the agreement we had) I cook and clean and wake up and make his lunch and he appreciates it but it's almost like what I do is not equivalent to him paying bills - keep in mind- I don't charge him rent, all he does is pay bills. I don't get an allowance, (not that I think I deserve one but I do know my worth, and money is good but somewhat tight as we're getting out of debt.) he throws bills in my face a lot, one of our main arguments! I tell him: he's going to pay bills no matter where he goes, i don't win anything from the situation besides not having to work, but at this point i want to drop him and just go back to working. But im scared to do so, cus I know once i become independent, i will not allow him around me. To each's own, but 50/50 dynamic doesn't work for me but I don't judge anyone else's dynamic. I feel im already bringing a lot of benefits to the table. If im going to go 50/50 on bills, it is unfair and I will get taken advantage more than I alr am. He pays the bills eventually but after a long drawn out argument. I've said it bothers me, and it has lessened with time but is still prevalent. I help my brother with some of his rent, (whole other story, but it has to do with my paid off house) I needed $200 to cover brothers rent, and he won't help me. He said it's not his problem. But him wanting me to be a sahm, with little income, makes it my problem. I understand on one side, but for all I do for him, for as much as he begs for me back, I don't see why he wouldn't want to help me. Keep in mind, this is less than 24 hrs after he's BEGGING for another chance. I don't charge my rent, I do so much for him. ****I almost feel like a slave & taken advantage of. Like nothing I do is good enough He also fights with me over dumb stuff, like food. I observed this and feel it must come from prison and I've shed light on this and he agrees but he doesn't change. I feel he tears me down a lot, I try to work on projects around the house but start to feel discouraged if I don't finish a project right away. (He's valid, I will say) but I don't have many interactions with ppl, so it's like the few interactions I do have is him being negative or saying negative things to me. Sometimes true, sometimes not. I have no issue being alone, but I do love him, which is why I keep giving him chances. Recently he's been wanting more space. I know where he's at, I have his location but it like I'm annoying him. I try to talk to him in the phone and he will for a bit but then starts to get annoyed, when before it wasn't that way. Says he's \"frustrated\" Finally, I think I may have given way too many chances. I do stand up for myself, don't reach out etc, but when I eventually give him another chance mind you- (after he literally BEGS & pleads and swears to change his behavior) and everytime less than 48 hours later he's back bullying me or saying something dumb or fighting over something n or acting as if I annoy him or he needs \"space\" to get work done. Recently, he was actually crying and begging to come home, I let him, idk why I thought things would be different, but when I woke up he was gone running errands, they were valid errands and again, I have location but still. I just feel taken advantage of and SO DRAINED after today. Since then, we've continued to fight & I wish I would've never allowed him back in to my space when I was so at peace. It's like picking an almost healed scab off.**He says he wants to stop hurting me but he doesn't know why he does it and it makes him feel horrible inside because I'm such a good person to him. I'm his first real relationship. I know he wants to change but idk how to encourage him to stay changed instead of reverting back to his patterns. He's acknowledged he needs counseling, I agree. But what should I do? Is there any way this can be saved or do I simply HAVE to leave? I know this post is long and all over the place but please have some grace with me, I don't know where else to turn and am just mentally exhausted, which is why my writing isn't as organized as i would want. Thank you and God bless.",

    "text": "hello! i've been struggling with what to do. i've been in a relationship with my boyfriend for almost two years. he's my first boyfriend (counting out the online ones when i was a young teenager). firstly, i've always been a hopeless romantic. i'm quite sheltered and too soft-hearted. i love all kinds of love and i've always had healthy role models for it in my life. the first year into our relationship, it was dreamy for me. then, it came to sexual encounters. it was my first time and i've never had any experience with it. i sort of felt pressured half of the year. i do agree to it, but deep down i was scared that i'd be disappointing him if i didn't go through with it. then, catching him liking other girl's reels and posts happened too. i was naive that time, trusted him a lot. i cried for months by myself and i begged him to change. he said he would. a few months after that, i caught him adding and talking to someone from an online chatting platform to his facebook. then arguments, so many arguments. whenever i was confronting him with something he'd make a monologue about his life and the things he's going through. i've always tried to be patient and understand him, but it felt as though he only uses them to fire back at me. whenever i'd ask about how he is, he tells me that i smother him. in all of those back in the year, i cried. and he'd still continue arguing even when i do. he'd tell me that i was too sheltered. that i don't know how life works. that i was self-centered and a pussy. then, he starts competing with me? about my looks, my interests, whenever i accomplish something that made me proud, he'd always shut it down. it hurt me, so much. i think it changed a part of my brain. i stopped being soft and i stopped crying. maybe it became a self-defense mechanism—just learning to care less. it felt better not having to be told i was too clingy or too selfish of his time if i just stopped everything. it worked. he's still doing everything i've begged a year for him to stop, but it just hurt less now. it doesn't even hurt at all. learned to say no even when he throws a tantrum about not having sex for a year. i'm naive, i know. i just don't know what to do anymore. i tried to break things off multiple times, but i always break down whenever i see him crying. i have a great relationship with his family too. i'm healing right now, focusing on myself more! even if he does pew out backhanded comments, i'm choosing myself than pleasing him. its just tiring having to choose to be dismissive to protect myself. i'm a very affectionate person and i give my heart whole, but i don't want the same thing to happen again. thank you for reading, i hope everyone is having a great day!",

    "text": "Hey, I've(28m) been dating this woman (28f) for 2 years now and things are getting really toxic. It started off good to some extent but I came in always dumping and talking about my hate for my job and how I wanted to be better and do better with myself and I thought she wanted me to be vulnerable but I missed the mark on allowing her to be vulnerable as well as I'd often make things solely about my struggles. She confronted me about it and I started to work on it but she came in with a lot of disrespect and gender roles. She started calling me names early on, yelling at me and basically saying things to belittle and trigger me. But we got past that and she got better and so did I too equally going to therapy and working it out. Now most recently we've started having these bad fights like once every 2 months where I'd tell her she isn't a good person and partner and she'd tell me I never made her happy and that she was doing good when she met me and I'll tell her that I don't enjoy the sex. These will be so heated sometimes that it just takes a toll on us. I know these are bad traits but I believe it's not all been bad and me being a reasonable person is like to fix things as I actually planned to propose later this year. I want a happy relationship with her but I need help. Is this something that can be fixed ??",

    "text": "Hi everyone, This is going to be long, but I need to get this out because it's eating me alive. I spent a big part of my life in a relationship with a man who completely reshaped who I am – not in a good way. When we met, I was strong, bright, full of life. Slowly, that girl disappeared. At first, he was charming and attentive. He made me feel like I was the most special person in the world. But once he knew I loved him deeply, things shifted. • Control: He slowly isolated me from people who cared about me. Any friend he didn't like, he'd convince me they were \"bad for me.\" I started cutting ties just to avoid fights. • Manipulation: Whenever I tried to speak up about something that hurt me, he'd turn it around – suddenly I was \"too sensitive,\" \"imagining things,\" or even \"the toxic one.\" • Emotional abuse: He knew exactly how to make me doubt myself. Sometimes he'd ignore me for days as punishment, then come back acting like nothing happened. • Breaking boundaries: If I said \"no\" to something, he'd push until I gave in – from small things to serious, intimate situations. I felt like my voice didn't matter. • False hope: After every painful episode, there was a cycle – tears, apologies, promises to change. I clung to those moments because I loved him and wanted to believe him. It wasn't all bad. There were times I felt loved and safe. That's what made it so confusing. I thought if I just loved him harder, tried to be \"better,\" he'd finally stop hurting me. Instead, I lost myself piece by piece. When I finally left, it wasn't just a breakup – it was like escaping a prison I didn't realize I was locked in. But even now, months later, I'm not free. Every time he texts me, my hands shake. I answer shortly, politely, because part of me still feels afraid to upset him. I hate that he still has this hold over me. I've tried therapy, self-help books, everything people suggest… but my confidence is shattered. I don't know who I am without him. I keep wondering if I'll ever feel whole again, if I'll ever have a healthy, safe love. I know people will say \"you're better off, just block him.\" But unless you've lived through manipulation this deep, you can't understand how stuck it makes you feel inside. I'm scared to truly cut the last tie, even though I know I should. Has anyone here survived something like this and actually healed? How do you stop feeling like your abuser still owns part of you even after you've walked away?",

    "text": "After two years wasted on someone I thought I'd spend my entire life with, I finally left him almost two months ago. The first year was amazing. I really thought my luck had changed — no more dating shitty men who only wanted to hurt me. No more verbal abuse, no more mental abuse. I genuinely thought I'd found my happy ending. We got married after a year (just a small wedding with our parents and siblings). We talked about all the important stuff, and it felt right. But at the time, I couldn't get a good job because of my health and multiple surgeries I'd had over the past nine months. That's when the fights began — and looking back, it should've been an obvious red flag. He started making me feel guilty about my health, something I couldn't control. Even though I had a job that paid my bills and left me some extra for myself, every argument turned into him blaming me for not making at least 70k a year, saying I was ruining his future. Whenever his friends or family came to visit, he'd treat me like I didn't exist. And the last couple months before I left, it felt like we were just roommates. When I finally asked what was going on, he told me he was embarrassed to be with me and just wanted to be friends. That hurt so deeply, because we'd promised each other that if either of us was falling out of love, we'd be honest so we wouldn't drag the other person along. The next night, I packed up all my stuff, took my two cats, and moved back home to my parents' house. The first two weeks were so hard — I was a complete mess — but now, I've never been happier. I'm now Twitch affiliated, I have so much more time for my friends, and most importantly, I feel free. I told him I can't be friends with someone I loved for two years and pretend I never had feelings, or pretend he didn't hurt me. Talking with my therapist made me realize he not only mentally abused me but also financially abused me. (I won't share the details because I'm still healing, and I also want to protect my process in case he ever finds this.) I just wanted to share my story because I know someone else out there might feel stuck like I did — but I promise, there is life after leaving. And sometimes leaving really is the beginning of everything getting better.",

She would always do good up until the relapse shed leave then email me or blow up my phone begging to come back and she needed me id fall for it everytime up to this point we are about 2 months back together moved out of the old spot and moved into a new spot I stayed there for a month realized she relapsed again and pretty much just let her know I don't want to go through what we always went through which was her calling the police and getting me put in jail ( if your a guy and ever caught a domestic you know what I'm talking about ) basically it was a Monday I woke up put my work boots on looked at her and told her she's better then this she had been up all night sniffing coc and keeping me up I leave for work she tells me since I'm not gonna love her I won't love anything and told me she put my dog outside and he's gonna stay outside telling me she hopes he gets stolen I went back to the house ( in the company van ) basically disregarding the sewer line repair I had this morning I was supposed to be at in a hour pulled up she pulls my hair out ( I have dreads ) I defend my self and ended up cutting her with my fingernail I think a very little mark on the side of her eye I leave she calls the police they get there I call my job and told them what happened they told me ( this was the second time ) I need to take time for myself basically got layed off ( Company Van is gone ) I called my lease office and asked if I could be tooken off the lease without having any type of eviction on my record she told me while I was crying on the phone to her she's gonna make sure I get took off the lease no reprruscissuons I was payed up to that point ( My place is gone ) mind you I'm a violent felon I caught a robbery when I was 17 years old as I'm writing this I'm 30 I did 2 years in jail got out and started plumbing walked down a 8 year probation sentence the only thing I've been in trouble for since then was this toxic relationship 2 domestic violence chargers now so if you understand what I'm saying you know how hard it was to get that place . Mind you now I have a warrant due to what she said this all happens in March . I move in with my sister mind you I have no job anymore I'm a felon I still have my car so I move up there I turn myself in for the warrant and bond out bond was 30,000 ( 10% of this ) so every bit of money I had saved for my job was used towards that I start a job around where my sister works but I've got court every week and have to drive 2 hours to court the job I picked up says they can't do the court stuff no more so I get fired . I'm living with my sister I'm a felon lawyer fees are now picking up I don't have a job nobody will hire me due to the felony fast forward a few months later I couldn't pay my sister got kicked out move in with my granny ( still have my car ) I get my old job back this last about a month .... mind you I'm paying lawyer fees helping my granny out and paying back everything I owe back to people from not working . Guess what happens next I've finally caught up I get pulled over they tell me I have a FAILURE TO APPEAR . I have kept in touch with my lawyer my bonds man and kept up with the court dates no one knew anything about this court date I never was informed about . I get arrested and the catching up I had did is now back to square 1 have to pay another bond and a week after that my transmission blows I've been to job interview after job interview I don't have a car anymore so don't have a way to work nobody around will hire me due to my felony. I know as men we think we can handle this and don't want to lose out on the woman we invested on or just think we can somehow fix it . Man when you know your relationship is over it's over look at what all I've lost in 5 months mind you every dollar I've made has been towards lawyer fees and bond fees and now I can't keep up anymore my plan is probably gonna be to just turn myself in and end it all and just do the time and fight it from jail . Leave that relationship my guy before it gets to late trust me I had it all to the PS5 the job that loved me that I could depend on the TVS every pair of J's the clothes the car and the company van the king sized bed brand new the nice furniture I'm just putting all this out there it can happen to you as well and will happen to you if you stay in that toxic relationship WOMAN to you will lose everything I can look at it as not fair but I don't I chose to keep taking her back I chose to keep thinking I can fix it look at me now I just hope someone reads this and it's a deal breaker leave PLEASE . She kept the place and lost it in 2 months ( never made one payment ) the place was destroyed ended up back in rehab and is pregnant ....

    "text": "I've been in a long-term relationship with someone I really care about, but I'm emotionally drained and unsure if it's worth continuing. She's extremely jealous and controlling. If I disappear for an hour, she starts questioning where I was. If I go somewhere, she wants me to send proof or a photo. If I'm in a bad mood, she assumes I don't love her anymore. She constantly checks who I follow on Instagram, especially if I follow a girl. She's even created fake accounts to test me, and once faked a chat between me and another girl to accuse me of cheating. Later, she admitted it was fake. She goes through my phone, Snapchat, even my car drawer, looking for anything suspicious. One time, she falsely claimed she saw something, only to say later \"maybe I was wrong.\" She even contacts my female followers asking how they know me, which is incredibly embarrassing and invasive. When things get too much and I try to step back or suggest ending things, she starts crying, begging, promising to change, saying this is the \"last chance\" every time. She also once said she would hurt herself if I left. I've given her multiple chances. Some changes happen, but temporarily. These extreme behaviors come back after a while. I'm starting to lose feelings, and I'm questioning whether I'm staying out of guilt or love. Has anyone been through this? Should I give her one last chance, or is this relationship already toxic beyond saving",

    "text": "Me (20f) and my fiance (21m) have been together for a year and a half, but there's something telling me to leave. I can't shake this anxious feeling. The start of our relationship was rocky. I wont say ive been an angel myself, ive put him through alot with my mental health and he has been unfairly exposed to my breakdowns ect whilst i recover from a previous abusive relationship but there are things my fiance has done that concern me he would trip me up whilst walking, and find it funny. One time when we were out in the pub with friends He showed everyone a private intimate message I'd sent him whilst I'd gone to the bathroom when i came back everyone knew. It caused me to be anxious about going to the toliet for ages incase I'd come back and he had shown people things I wouldn't want to be shared, I was humiliated. He would spam call me if I didn't reply for a long time, I once asked for space and he sat on the bed looking very distressed whilst I did some writing on my phone (I write peoms to cope) i asked him what was the matter and he wanted to know why I was on my phone typing for so long and demanded to see what I was doing. For a long time he didn't stand up to his mum who was been awful to me for several months and just would stand there whilst she spoke to me like rubbish, for a while I understood why he didn't stand up for me, his mother is abusive, and is a drug addict. Since he moved out its gotten better. But before then he would say his behaviour was because of his upbringing. And I belived it for ages but I've told him since we know have our own place together we both need to put in equal effort. for some reason recently even though nothing specific has caused my anxiety I feel there is something wrong. We recently spoke because I felt upset for a few days as everytime I'd go to kiss him or touch his hand he would pull away and pull a disgusted face at me. I felt very rejected. I understand I can be overly affectionate and I struggle to contain my excitement at times, so I have been trying to tone it down alot in fear I'm being to much. In the same point i feel im annoying my partner, i once a few months ago got stuck in a hoodie lol and i asked for help, i started wiggling whilst he tried to pull it over my head and he the shouted at me i cant remember what he said but as he did he grabbed my shoulders hard and almost shook me to stop me moving. Again I haven't been the best partner myself I've made mistakes, I've been in therapy for over a year and I'm slowly picking up habits on how to communicate before I feel too emotional to be rational. That's often the issue I cause, I can't communicate to my fiance without crying, putting myself down and feeling frustrated towards myself. when I've asked my partner to do something for ages like taking the bins out and when he leaves it for weeks to the point it overflows I try to talk to him about it but all I seem to do is cry and get ahead of myself. Then I feel super guilty because I feel like I'm making him feel bad. Am I making all this up? Should I be concerned things will go downhill in the future",

    "text": "If you've seen my last post, you'll know I usually try to see the good in him. People often tell me why they think I stay, but what I really want to understand is: why does he act like this? What makes someone behave this way? We're away at the seaside for a few days as a family. The drive was 4.5hrs and I packed everything and sorted what we needed. A few things have come up: We stopped halfway for our son, then hit some traffic coming out of the services. Somehow that was pinned on me, and it really affected his mood. He even said he wanted to turn around and go home. He got annoyed that I didn't offer to drive. He normally drives so it didn't cross my mind, and I don't feel confident driving in unfamiliar areas. Later, when we left one place, he asked me to drive. I did, but when I slowed down at a pedestrian crossing, he told me to get out and took over himself. On the way back to the hotel that evening, he said he was going to kick me out of the car. I hadn't said anything, and I think it was because I was quiet. He told me I need to grow up and drive more, which felt a bit harsh. Later, on a walk, our son got upset and he handed the buggy over quite abruptly and told me to \"deal with that\" or something similar. We had a quick coffee break and he said we might as well go home early, even though we're meant to stay another day. He got frustrated when I didn't answer my phone — he'd gone to the car and left his key in my bag, but I was busy with our son at the time. We also booked a beach trip and I'd said we should get lunch for our son first. He wanted to go straight there as there was a café on site, but it was full. So we ended up heading back early without even going on the beach. Breakfast felt rushed. he seemed on edge and doesn't like feeding our son in case he chokes, which meant I couldn't properly enjoy my breakfast or coffee. He has difficulty sitting in restaurants. Then later, I got blamed for sand in the car from the buggy. I'm not sure if it's me, our son, or just general stress, but it's felt like a lot. That said, he has done some things to help. He's got me coffee and breakfast when I've been feeding our son. He did all the driving here. Unloaded the bags. Paid for the hotel and other bits. Helped with our son at times. Looked up things for us to do. Didn't get angry when we get stuck in the rain. something that's always bothered him. Still, over the three days we've been away, he hasn't changed a single nappy. It's hard not to feel like I'm carrying the bulk of the mental and emotional load. TLDR: We're on a short family break. He's done a few helpful things like driving, paying for stuff, and sorting activities, but he's also been moody and snappy. I've felt blamed for small things, unsupported at times, and unsure whether the tension is just part of the stress or something more. I'm left wondering if it's me, or if I'm just feeling worn out.",

It's reached the point where all I do is fantasize about harm coming their way while I lie and pretend to stay safe. He's abusive and the most selfish person I've ever met. I just can't get out of this yet, and I don't want advice. I just need to let this out. To literally anyone. I'm so alone in Al of this and it's so depressing how disgustingly trapped I feel in my life. Some days I think the only way I'll ever be free from him is actual death. He knows that too. Yet he thinks this is some fantasy romance. I don't even touch him and he clings to me. Why?!? Why can't he just cling to someone else???",

    "text": "I'm not sure where to post this, but I really need some outside perspective. I was in a two-year on-and-off relationship that has left me emotionally wrecked, and I can't tell if I was being emotionally abused or if I just lost myself in something deeply confusing and painful. Writing this is really difficult because I can hardly express all the little things I felt. The confusion, the emotional instability, the way I started to constantly question myself. There were so many moments where I felt like I was losing my mind and couldn't figure out what was real anymore. In the beginning, it felt intense and consuming. We spent so much time together and both struggled. We were isolated, depressed, adjusting to college, and just felt completely lost. But as time went on, the relationship turned into this endless emotional rollercoaster. He would pull me in with love, affection, and connection, and then, out of nowhere, completely switch off. He would go from saying he loved me and acting like everything was okay to becoming cold, avoidant, and cruel. like flipping a switch. It was like the second I became emotionally vulnerable, he would completely withdraw or lash out. Any time I cried or tried to express how his actions were hurting me, he made me feel like my pain was inconvenient. He'd get cold, condescending, and act like I was being dramatic just for feeling anything at all. He didn't just shut down he made it very clear that he didn't want to deal with me. If I tried to talk through something calmly, he'd twist it and say I was manipulating him or trying to guilt him. He'd turn my attempts at communication into something shameful. And during fights or breakups, he would outright belittle me. He'd call me pathetic, ridiculous, crazy, overly emotional. He once said that he couldn't care less about me and that I was pathetic for ever staying with him. I was constantly made to feel like I was the problem just for wanting reassurance or clarity. He yelled at me a lot during arguments. I'd tell him to stop, that it was scaring me, and he would either deny he was yelling or just keep going. I'd end up completely shut down, crying, or leaving because I couldn't handle it anymore. He would often use this against me and say that all I do is cry and leave and never want to fix anything like a child. There were so many breakups, and they were always abrupt. He would discard me like I meant nothing, usually right after I asked for clarity or expressed any kind of emotional need. Once it was the day after my grandfathers funeral and once over text while I was on a trip. There was no warning, no explanation just a switch flipped. And then weeks or even days later, he'd come back with some intense emotional story or grand gesture. He'd write me a letter, tell me he missed me, say he loved me, that he wanted to fix things. The 180 was so jarring. He once told me he had relapsed on pills and was suicidal and needed me. Another time, he left a note saying \"I'm a sociopath, you were right about me.\" Another time he showed up to my house saying he was in a car accident and was worried that I haven't talked to him recently… I don't even know what was real and what was manipulation. But every time I started to move on, he knew exactly what to say to make me question everything and pull me back in. In May, he left a five-page love letter on my car. It was full of memories, apologies, and promises. He said I was the one, that he wanted to marry me, that he was sorry for all the pain he caused me. We talked, hung out, said we loved each other. But almost immediately after that, he started to pull away. His warmth disappeared. The emotional depth was gone. He became dry, distant, and disconnected. I ended things because I couldn't handle the confusion anymore but I still wanted something, so a few days later, I called him. He snapped. He yelled at me, told me I was pathetic, childish, crazy. Said he had no feelings for me, didn't care, and that I was delusional to think he ever wanted to be with me. I was crying, and he didn't care. He just kept going. It felt like he wanted to destroy whatever was left of me. Now it's July, and he's already with a new girl. They're posting photos together. He never posted me. I found out through other people, and I feel sick. It's like I was erased. Like none of it was ever real. Like I was just some emotional placeholder until someone else came along. I know I wasn't perfect in the relationship. But I always tried. I was always the one apologizing, explaining, reaching out, trying to repair the damage. I was emotionally available. I wanted to understand him and love him the right way. But he never showed up for me like that. I don't think he ever truly tried. I feel ashamed for going back so many times, but I also feel heartbroken and hollow. I loved him. I believed him. I wanted to believe in us. But now I feel like I lost myself in something that was never safe. Was this narcissistic abuse? Emotional manipulation? Or just a relationship that broke me over time? Any insight would mean a lot. I feel like I'm still stuck in it, and I don't know how to let go",

    "text": "All I ask is that you listen with an open mind. I never cheated. I never lied. I did my best to be a good boyfriend emotionally, financially, physically. But in the end, none of that mattered. My feelings didn't matter. I was made out to be the villain, even when I was the one hurting. And just to be clear: I was never the jealous type. I never tried to control her. I encouraged her to live her life, spend time with friends, do what made her happy. I never told her what to do or control her. This was, without a doubt, the most toxic, manipulative, and narcissistic person I've ever met. She twisted every situation to make herself the victim, constantly gaslit me, and made me question my own reality. No matter how much I gave or how patient I it was never enough because the truth is, it was never about love or partnership. It was always about control and hurting someone. To this day, I still don't know what I did to deserve the way she treated me. I never gave her a reason to think I was unfaithful, but that's what she called me. I was never verbally abusive or abusive. If anything i felt like the one going through it. the only time I ever laid a hand on her was at Disneyland, and I'll get to that later. That moment broke me. And yes, I still carry guilt for it. But I was not the monster she made me out to be. I. Swear to you guys that in telling the truth, if a guy or even girl is going through something similar, think about your situation. Put you first. There's a lot more, I wish I could say but I'm trying to keep this short as possible. I was young 20 or 21 when we started dating. We met through mutual friends, and not even two weeks in talking, she asked me to be her boyfriend. I told her I wasn't ready. I had just gotten out of a relationship. She turned away and cried, and even though I didn't want to jump in too fast, I didn't want to hurt her either so I stuck around and told her to be patient. That should have been the first red flag. 🚩 A month in asked her out, still felt too soon. But i liked her. So In the beginning, everything seemed great. She wrote me letters, gave me small gifts, even bought me a PS4 later on. She told me her parents didn't support her, that she had to \"fight\" just to spend time with me. That made me see her as someone misunderstood. It made me want to protect her. Finally i met her parents and they actually seem alright i even bonded with her dad he was the much cooler and understanding person. I started working with him, learned flooring and carpet cleaning. I had more fun with him than I did with her most days. But when he asked me, \"Are you planning to marry my daughter?\" it felt more like a warning than a question. Now I get why. She would tell me her family was against her, her cousins were fake, her parents didn't understand her and I believed her. I thought it was me and her against the world. But the truth is… the common problem wasn't everyone else. It was her. As time went on, she changed. She became controlling. Jealous over everything. If I was with friends, she'd blow up my phone. If was with my girl cousins, she'd accuse me being shady. If I didn't respond fast enough, it became an argument. She once even replied to a guy on Twitter that she didn't have a boyfriend just to spite me. I hadn't even done anything to cause that. I confronted the guy, and she told him she had \"no idea who I was.\" We broke up briefly after that, but she begged me to come back. Her mom even called me in tears, asking me to forgive her. So I gave her another chance. On my birthday, she bailed on the celebration because of a miscommunication I thought she was starting another fight through text, and I responded harshly. I messed up. I can admit that. But she never let it go. For the rest of our relationship, every single argument brought it back up. It never ended. She blocked doors when I tried to leave during arguments. I wanted space to cool down, it would probably help both of us. She yelled and told me I wasn't a real man for walking away. She'd compare me to her exes, and even to her brothers, saying they treated their girlfriends better than I treated her. It got into my head and it started to feel like I was the problem. She went through my phone constantly. I didn't even care most of the time, but the one time I said no because I was tired of it, she blew up. Accused me of cheating. Told her mom, and of course, her mom believed her. Every little disagreement her parents got involved. It was like her mom was coaching her. I couldn't win. She later decided she wanted to stop having sex. Said she was waiting until marriage after we already had. I respected her body and her decision, but when I tried to express how it made me feel, she shut me down, got angry. My feelings didn't matter. I was so loyal, I even bought a pocket pussy just so i can give myself pleasure. That's how far I went to stay faithful. I paid for everything dates, gifts, her birthday. I didn't mind, but she never seemed to appreciate it. And when I couldn't afford her Disneyland ticket, she used that against me. The reason I bring this \"paying\" stuff because when it was my birthday you know what she got me? A basket of snack and a candle:/ don't get me wrong i loved it but common if i go out all on you i expect the same. I did try to tell her how i felt, she got so upset and call me \"ungrateful\". She told she was broke and had no money and i understand because that was me as well, but then i found out she bought her brother shoes:/ am i crazy for feeling some type of way? That night at Disneyland was the worst moment of my life. She got angry in a gift shop because I told her to not spend money on expensive pins. She stormed off. Called me, crying, saying I never chase after her. Then her mom called me, telling me of stop making her daughter cry. It never mattered what really happened she was always right in their eyes. Later, after drinks at the Star Wars bar, we got into another argument. In the car, she spit on me. Twice. Then she hit me. And I snapped. I hit her back once. Her nose started bleeding. I cried. I was ashamed. That's not who I am. But after months of emotional abuse I broke. I truly believe she wanted me to snap. She needed a reason to finally label me the abuser. And after that, mutual friends stopped talking to me. She had her story. And people believed it. We stayed together a little longer, but everything was different. She started acting like she couldn't stand being around me. I saw the breakup coming. During all this, I relapsed. Pills oxys, hydros, perks 10 pills a day. I overdosed. Ended up in detox. Rehab. I didn't tell her right away. Not because I didn't care, but because I didn't feel safe telling her anything anymore. Everything I shared was used against me. When I finally told her, she didn't care. I could hear it in her voice. She broke up with me while I was in rehab when I needed her most. This relationship broke me. I was always there for her when she had fights with her family, when she was sick, when she felt alone. I showed up. I dropped everything. But when I needed her… she vanished. I don't know what I did to deserve that kind of treatment. I know I wasn't perfect. I made mistakes. But I know I never lied. I never cheated. I never tried to control her. I was patient. I was loyal. I was present. She made me believe I was the bad one but now, looking back, I know I was the one trying.",

    "text": "I (20/F) was single for three years because I was in an extremely toxic relationship from ages 15 to 17 with a guy who is now 20/M. we started dating our freshman year of high school on February 13th 2020, and he broke up with me on June 11th, 2022. all of my friends hated him, and my dad hated him and yet threw it all. I still I was convinced that there was nobody else for me. I'm being reminded of how poorly he treated me because I am now in a healthy relationship (19/M) with a guy who is a provider he's going to join the army and overall he treats me very well. Sometimes he will come over to see me on a day. We didn't plan it just because I asked if he would even if it was as a joke, my ex-boyfriend would always cancel plans last minute and one time even ditched me to go smoke weed with his ex-girlfriend. It's taking me a lot of time to realize but I was sexually assaulted twice in this relationship. The first time we were 15 and cuddling on the couch and he suddenly just fingered me. It hurts so bad but I convinced myself I wanted it I even wrote in my journal what he did, but I knew that I wanted it in hindsight I didn't. I never considered that it could be sexual assault because he stopped when I asked him too, but he still never asked me. The second time he started fingering me and while we were in a sexual scenario before I didn't want him to finger me I kept telling him no I don't want this, and he kept going. He only stopped when his hand started to cramp I would beg him to just talk to me because he would ghost me for weeks on end and when he wouldn't text me on days, we did see each other at school. His excuse was we would see each other at school so he didn't need to text me, but I still would've really appreciated. Good night texts and whatever. I am now aware I have an anxious attachment style, and he was avoidant. But I still stayed with him. I couldn't bring myself to leave him, and when I did try to break it off, he crawled back into my life. during April 2022, I was going through a depressive episode that lasted several months. I was in the worst mental state I'd been in in a long time, and I was finally happy in June, because my boyfriend at the time agreed to go with me. but then, the day of, he breaks up with me. when we were back at school, he was still walking me home, even kissed me, and said I love you. I was getting mixed signals, so I finally asked him what was going on between us. he held my face in his hand and said he didn't even know if he loved me anymore. then, senior year, we talk a little bit, but only because we had advisory together. we didn't talk for so long after, but in April of 2024, he hits me up. now at this point, I was in college and I had come to terms with what kind of a person he is, and I no longer felt any empathy for him. well, I told him I had realized what he'd done and how uncomfortable he made me, so he apologized, which I never expected. he then went on and on about how much he mistreated me and how he wished he wasn't so stupid. so, stupidly enough, I invited him over. just to hangout, I didn't have an plans of hooking up with him. but he started to get touchy (not sexually, but romantically, yk) and I gave in and cuddled him. we then wounded up kissing, and we had sex. he came in me without consent, and did not tell me until minutes after. after he left, he ghosted me until around february of 2025. I stupidly missed him enough to invite him over again, even after everything. I still didn't have plans to make a move on him or anything, but he hugged me the moment he saw me. when we got upstairs to my room, I gave him a chocolate because we were hanging out on February 13, which if we had stayed together, would've been our five year anniversary. after I give him the gift, he hops on me and kisses me, which led to more. he even told me he loved me this day. he treated me like his girlfriend again. but then, as soon as he left, he went back to ghosting me, and I realize once again how stupid I was for thinking he'd change as mentioned before, I'm with a much better guy now, and I hope the best for our future together. but him treating me so well makes me realize even more how poorly treated I was in my last relationship, and I would like advice to get over the abuse.",

    "text": "I just moved to a new town and I need some advice from people outside of my situation to give me advice. I am feeling scared and upset and I don't. Want to make a bad decision out of emotion or fear.I've been with my partner for 13 years. I met him when I was 18 and I did not see then the red flags that were so glaringly obvious for abuse & control. We now have a beautiful child together. A son who is 2 years old and 3 pets. 2 cats and a dog. I feel like a statistic. He's taken away my freedom. He abuses me often behind closed doors verbally and emotionally. And physically on rare occasions. He does it in front of my son and I am terrified of the mental damage this could cause him. I don't drive. But I am learning. I got my learners and am actively practicing driving so I can get a job in the new town I live in, grow friendships, and ultimately gain my independence. My partner has convinced me to not work and raise our son. Our son will be old enough soon to go to preschool and by then I want to be ready able to drive so I can line up a job. The abuse started two years into our relationship. He proposed while on vacation with his family. I was alone with only his relatives in another country. He proposed while we were on a bot (I'm extremely Seasick) and I asked him to wait until I wasn't covered in puke. I explained that I wanted to say yes but I was feeling gross and sick and wanted it to be a better memory. He screamed swore followed me to our shared hotel room and trashed the room. I went to the bed to cover my face where he kept screaming hitting me destroying. My belongings the hotel and even threatened to rip up my passport. That was the first instance and I should have ran away then. But as abusers often do I've read abo it abuse cycles. The highs and lows of his moods would often throw me off. On good days he would be generous and cheerful. Taking me out on nice dates buying me gifts being nice to me. On off days he became increasingly abusive. And before I knew it the bad days became more frequent. I don't know how I didn't see the pattern of abuse for what it was way back then. These days I am lucky if he goes a 24 hour period without screaming swearing or being abusive in other ways. He does it in front of my son. He threatens me if I leave him. I did try leaving him once. When my son was 6 months old. I felt the man I was with was out of control. He has clear problems with anger management. He's lied in the past often about going to counseling. We did try couples counselling but after a few sessions he refused to continue. He lied during those sessions to the therapist and refused to do the homework she gave us anyways. He had the police called on him by a concerned neighbour when we shared an apartment. The cops came he ran away. I stupidly chose not to press charges. But after giving birth to my son I haven't been able to ignore his behaviour. The concern for my son grows every day. While he's never been physically abusive to my son he has been extremely Neglectful. To make this story short he does things like not giving him food or water when he says he's. Watching him. Things like avoiding changing his diapers at all costs. If I ask if he's eaten or just check up on my son in any way he immediately gets angry screams and often says things like I'm not allowing Him to be a father. Or I'm keeping our son from being with him somehow. During the 9 months or so that I left him his abusive behaviour escalated. He had broke into my laptop and deleted every file on it. He refused to give me my mail from our former residence. He pretended to take my dog on a walk (the same Dog he refuses to pay for) claiming it's his dog and not mine. He pretended to walk him one day and then just stole him drove off with him without explanation. I arranged during this time for him to see his son anytime he wanted to within reason. Stating I needed 48 hours notice in case I needed to arrange my plans outside of his needs (basically to allow me to work if I found a job or have a social life of my own). I was extremely sleep deprived during this time. And over the years especially since having my son I've had medical issues that have made it so that I face extreme chronic pain and reduced mobiltiy. Because I couldn't drive separating was very difficult and the government programs were not enough to help me with food let alone rent To get back on my feet. Friends that were mutual who I have had for over 10 years had finally seen how abusive he was behind closed doors and urged me to take my son and pets and move in with them until we found a safe place to live during the separation. I finally felt seen. I finally felt like I had my village. Until then I had had no one and faced this entirely on my own. I had to navigate endless sleepless nights with my son before I had left my partner. To the point where I felt Very much like a married single parent. He had proposed 5 times before our son was born. Each time he'd announce it on social media. Take photos and attention then blow up at me screaming and swearing if I even asked him any details like when the wedding date would be. We're still not married just living together because I stupidly went back. During our time apart I even had to get police involved to get my dog back. I had to show them papers to show I care and pay for him that he is in fact mine. I made it so that my partner could see our son on weekends (when he had time off work) and catered to his schedule to make child visits while we were separated as easy as possible. Near Christmas when we were split he stopped showing up to these visits every weekend after just a few months of this arrangement. I told him once the courts decide what our custody will be this is the best I can do to ensure he can see our son as often as he likes. When he stopped showing up I asked him point blank why he stopped coming. He claimed he was too depressed to visit our son. When I asked why he said it was because he couldn't see our son and was being kept from him during the holidays. The entire time he had a huge smear campaign set up against me. Telling his friends family etc anyone who would listen how I was keeping our son from him how I in fact was the abusive one and how he wanted full custody. It makes my blood boil today. He claimed he was a changed man (not the first time he's done this) asking for a fresh start. Which is why I moved back in with him. My friends who I lived with at the time were very upset with me for deciding to give him another chance and instead of being there for me cut all contact off from me. We moved back to our hometown shortly After this. The bank sent us a letter that I opened saying he was no longer paying the mortgage. So I bailed him out. Once again terrified of being homeless with a baby. I did it for our son and I. Not for him. He's lied to me so many things both big and small I sometimes wonder if he's actually delusional. My former couples therapist warned me in our private session that he may be a narcissist. It took me until after our son was born to have that aha moment. To see the abuse cycle plainly for what it was and realize I had a child with a monster. During the birth of my son for instance he ignored me during labour. When I told him all I wanted as someone to talk to me and hold my hand because I was scared and this was my first childbirth. I ended up needing an emergency c section were my son and I both almost died. I was emergency airlifted to a better hospital it was very scary. The entire time I gave birth my partner ignored me and played his on his Nintendo switch because he did not want to not play the new Zelda game when it came Out. It left me traumatized. And after the birth my physical health and mobility once again declined. My former friends shut me out because they disapproved of my decision to get back together. My partner has guilted me gaslit me everything under the sun for me to feel bad about leaving him and breaking up the family. And when I finally did realize what was going on and tried to leave I did not have the money or support to do so. In the meantime I have desperately Hoped my partner would get help for his anger issues and at least knowledge that what he's done to me over the years is abuse. His version is that I'm abusive and controlling often calling me a Nazi or a hypnotic when I express any safety concern for my child. I make sure to watch over him closely so he's never in danger. But I often worry if one day he will explode at my son and I live in constant fear. I am working on driving. Doing physical therapy exercises and actively Looking for a job also. I've exhausted all help possible from government and church resources in my area and am living in an isolated area where you can only get around by driving. I've saved my half of the money from our house sale. Meanwhile my partner has blown through his half quickly. I am still full time stay at home and at most my partner comes home from work around 7-8 and puts him to bed on occasion and plays with him. While I'm appreciative that he does on occasion now help with our sons care he shows me he is not capable of always addressing his needs unsupervised and continues to tell his family that I am abusive and controlling. Meanwhile he tells me he wants to get married and have a second child. I am so sick of his lies I feel sick. But I also feel helpless and need to rely on him for a roof and food for my son in the meantime. I feel like I'm stuck in this impossible Situation. I am practicing self care and am trying to work to create that village that I didn't have before. I made some amazing friends who live near me who have kids near my son's age who play well together and meeting them has been a dream. I have not told them about my partners behaviour because now he has met them. And puts on a show about what a great dad he is in front of them and anyone else who is watching. His social media is filled with staged selfies of him and our son but behind closed doors he is a loose cannon and anything sets off his anger and he does anything to avoid spending time with me and our son. Once he created an argument out of nowhere then drove off to live at his moms for 4 days without a word. Then came back pretending everything is fine. His anger is semi under control as long as I happily pretend to play house. But everyday he comes home I feel physically ill from having to pretend im happy out of fear. The stress has made me vomit so badly that I cough and puke several times a week. The mutual friends I made at my new home now think he's a saint and it absolutely makes my stomach churn knowing the monster he truly is, how helpless I've become and how hard I've worked to free my son and pets and I from this nightmare only for all of my effort to amount to nothing. He has made it clear that if I try to leave him again he will purposefully make my life hell. He will sue me go o after me with lawyers and has threatened physical harm. My dad has stage 4 cancer and I don't want to and can't lean on him for support. I've applied for jobs non stop for months with no luck. I can't drive on my own yet and I don't want to leave my partner again before I know I can be independent and give him a good Life. My partner has also threatened me for full custody even though I know he has no interest in actually being. With our son. The first time he split he said he would drop him off at his grandmas house (my partners mom) rather than have me stay and care for him in my own home just to spite me. He doesn't care what's best for him. And I know where I live the court considers parental rights equally without always taking into account if a parent is abusive or the actual safety of a child which is absolutely Backwards and heartbreaking. He constantly records me in my own home. I have no privacy. No freedom. If I confront him for the abuse all he does is turn it around somehow and tell me I'm the abusive one. It makes me feel crazy I am completely alone and want to protect my son. What should I do? Thank you I realize this is a long post. Thank you for reading. I am Desperate for help or kindness. My son is an absolute gem and I don't want him to grow up to be like His father.",

    "text": "Hi everyone. I've been in a relationship with my boyfriend for 4 years. We've been living together for 2 of those years. I'm realizing that along the way, I've completely lost myself. When we first started dating, I made a lot of changes to make him happy. Some I thought were for the better, like working on my attitude in arguments, being softer and more feminine, and avoiding toxic friends who partied a lot. But I also gave up so much of myself. I stopped dancing, singing, painting, and drawing. When I do try to enjoy those hobbies, my time is cut short to tend to him, or he writes off me not being with him 24/7 as suspicious. I stopped spending much time with friends or family because he makes it feel untrustworthy even when I communicate where I'm going and who I'm with. From the beginning, he set a rule: anyone who had ever liked me, or that I had talked to or slept with, had to be removed from my life. I agreed. I was still growing out of a people-pleasing phase and wanted to show I could be trusted, plus in the very few months of us talking we did have issues with past relationships or sexual partners being in my phone. I admitted to having a promiscuous past before I met him, but always worked to better myself morally. But he'd \"test\" me—sending people to message me just to see how I'd respond. Then he used those harmless conversations against me. Over time, he got access to all my social media passwords. I didn't mind at first, thinking it meant transparency. But I never had his. He gave me access once, then logged me out and changed all his passwords, including his phone password. I stayed open while he snooped through my entire past, even canceling my Instagram deactivation to keep digging after asking me to delete is since I had so many men added( the account was from middle school until present) He doesn't cook, clean, make his own plate, or take much initiative around the house. I help care for his special needs brother, too. I even gave up living on campus, and eventually dropped out of school entirely just to be with him. Now I'm in debt for a degree I didn't finish, and I don't even know how to go back or start over. We've had serious issues, including physical altercations. I take accountability for times I escalated things, especially in year one, but he always goes further. He's slapped me, spit in my face, punched me in the stomach, pulled my hair, choked me. He's broken things, screamed insults, and gotten in my face during fights. I've only ever pushed, yanked, or bit him in defense—trying to get him off of me. I've never hit him in the face, and he's careful not to touch mine either so there's no visible evidence. Just a couple days ago, I tried to speak up during an argument, and he punched our dresser in front of me. My family doesn't know the full extent, just bits and pieces. My mom and sister are the only ones who've seen it firsthand, but they try to support how I'm handling things. My grandmother has always wanted me to leave, but we've had a complicated relationship too. She raised me, but never in a loving way, and some of the things I dislike about her—I now see in him.He has made an effort in the last 3–4 months to be calmer with me, but arguments still undo everything. The biggest fight in our relationship has been about sex. He wants it multiple times a day, more than 5 times a week. I'm more comfortable with 2 rounds, 3 times a week max. In our first 3 years, I had a Nexplanon implant that caused extremely heavy, prolonged periods (sometimes a full month at a time), but he wasn't considerate of how that affected my libido. He would throw in my face that he \"used to have two girlfriends\" and that, in his religion (Muslim), he could have up to 4 wives — threatening to bring other women into the relationship, which I've always been against.He says the lack of sex is the reason he disrespects me, starts arguments, and refuses therapy. If we have sex 3 days in a row and I say no the next day, he becomes mean — sending me rude Instagram posts that insult women or \"signs your girl is cheating\" memes with \"lol this u\" attached.I have love for him, but I'm not in love anymore. I've been holding onto the positive parts for so long, but I don't know if we'll ever get anywhere. I used to dream of kids with him (we had a miscarriage early on), and we share values for raising them — but I can't see him being present or treating me respectfully in front of them.Most people don't know the full story. My grandmother has always wanted me to leave, but we've had a strained relationship, and I think she disliked him from the start partly because I considered changing my religion for him. The truth is, I see a lot of traits in him that I also dislike in her.I want peace — my own apartment, my own space — but I'm stuck. Rent is high, my job pays poorly (we work at the same place), and my lease doesn't end until Jan/Feb 2026. My best friend has offered to get an apartment with me, but her lease ends at the same time. My grandparents' house is overcrowded and also toxic.I know leaving will be hard financially, emotionally, and logistically, but staying feels like I'm breaking myself more every day.I have spoken to my leasing office today and they told me that I have a couple of options but non of them sound appealing without having to call the police. If I can get a protection order I can be removed form the lease with no issues. If I get him and his brother to agree letting me off the lease I can do that as well. Or if I pay basically two months rent to break the lease. So my options of doing this in a fast and discreet way are slim.Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did you leave when you had nowhere safe to go right away? I can go with my grandparents but all my belongings are at risk of being destroyed because I can't bring everything with me. I have little to no money saved up or to my name I've been paycheck to paycheck.",

    "text": "I've been with my boyfriend for almost 2 years. Over time, I've noticed a painful pattern: unless the conversation is about sex or his interests, he doesn't seem engaged with me at all. Most conversation starters come from me, and he rarely asks follow-up questions. He never asks about the books I'm reading, the shows I'm watching, or how my day went. If he does, it's surface-level and quickly shifts back to himself. But when it's about sex or sexting, he's suddenly enthusiastic and invested. Recently, I told him my endometriosis pain was really bad. His response was, \"Can you work from home?\" and then he switched to talking about himself. It made me feel invisible. This happens every single time. He's never wished me luck for interviews, told me he's proud of me for getting promoted. Just silence. It feels like he is jealous of me if anything. He loves to put me down and make me feel stupid if I don't know a fact or haven't heard of something before. We don't live together, but there are days he'll ignore me for hours or barely message. Last night, he didn't even say goodnight. A while back, during the night, he woke up and told me how much he can't stand sharing a bed with me. He has a history of emotional neglect and being defensive when I bring things up. During my miscarriage, he ignored me. Sometimes I wonder if he only values me when I'm sexual with him. And when I try to express how hurt or dismissed I feel, he often tells me I'm \"overly sensitive\" — which just makes me question myself even more. I'm starting to think I should stop initiating conversations just to see what happens… but I'm scared of the answer.",

    "text": "I've been trying to hold out for as long as I could with work, helping my family, and being a good person to myself and others. I kept trying to reconcile with my ex who physically assaulted me and has kept viewing me as someone who is out to destroy him. I don't have it in me to do that nor do I have ill will towards others. I've been silently suffering for the past few months as I can't let anyone know because the moment I do the law and medical personnel will become involved. I don't want to stress my friends or family out. I thought this could be resolved by being more cordial to him and resolve our issues by being more complacent and not trying to upset him. Once again, I somehow made him upset because he was over analyzing my location, he didn't like the photos I took for him because they're \"inconsistent\", and I didn't send him a photo of my work outing after he was verbally abusive to me on Saturday. One of the last things he said to me through text was \"You are unloveable\" and \"I will replace you by the end of the night\". He's so concerned about me moving on and talking to others when I'm pretty sure he was seeing others the entire time. He had made it known to me that there are people waiting on him. I really am at my wits end. I don't want to be alive most days. I hate that I have to pretend to be okay to please those around me. I know if I did anything against myself my family and friends would be disappointed in me. It just really hurts to be alive right now and I am coping by drinking excessively. I wish someone can see the pain that I'm in. I wish I never had this relationship trauma. I feel like I deserve to suffer.",

We've had a rocky start, I would say we are emotionally abusive towards each other, but i love him so much, it's my first ever relationship, and it's incredibly hard to leave. We had a break before, due to his jealousy issues and lack of trust, which was too much to handle for both of us. Right now we are happily together, we fight about small things every day, but nothing too bad. Today though he showed me a TikTok about clubbing somewhere while i was laying on his chest. It is a huge arguement everytime i try to go out, but it was a famous club and I said \"woww i'd like to go there\". He was like \"oh really oh really\" in a joking way but started pinching my stomach very very hard a couple of times, and also lowkey chocked me for a couple of seconds with his arm. I said wtf and he was like \"I will kill you if you go\" 😭 writing this down made me realise that it is actually crazy, but my question is, could this escalate to physical abuse?",

    "text": "Me & my bf have been seeing each other 2 years now. He's a very well known entrepreneur (club promoter/event organizer) from my hometown (he has a lot of girls, celebrities, & \"clout\" in his face a lot & is financially well off). I know him because he's my childhood friend's brother so I've known him my whole life but we just started seeing each other 2 years ago. I'm a senior in college so when I first started seeing him it was because we ran into each other due to him having a lot of events going on in the city where I go to school at the time which is about 4 hours from our hometown. He tried to get with me before when I was a freshman but I was too scared to talk to him because of my friend. We became intimate very early. At first for the weeks he was in my university town I'd stay at his condo, going there after class & being with him all day, spending the night. When he had to go back home he'd have me drive home every Friday after class to stay with him for the weekend & go back early Monday morning. It sounds outrageous being a 4 hour drive there & back every weekend but he was paying for my gas & my food & everything every weekend so it didn't feel as outrageous at the time it felt like he was taking care of me. Throughout the week he'd give me money to get my nails done if needed or my hair. I have daddy issues so him being older too really turned me on. This summer I got an internship back home so I've been home all summer & with him everyday for the past 4 months. Now he doesn't want me to go back to school next week. I only have 2 semesters left. I only have class on Tuesday/Thursday & I already made my work schedule to where I have Friday-Monday off so I can drive back home to him. But it's not enough now. He wants me to transfer to the university back home or take 2 semesters of so I can transfer to fully online. He said if I go back we're breaking up & I have no been okay. Graduating from the university I'm at right now means so much to my family it's their alma mater literally everyone on my mom & dad's side. My mom recently lost her dad (my grandpa) over the summer so it means so much more now. They've put so much time & money into putting me through school these last 5 years (especially my grandparents) if I left in my last 2 semesters they'd be so devastated. They pay for my car & apartment. They'd probably cut me off completely. I'd have no where to go but my boyfriend. I've lost friends over him too, 2 of my childhood friends have cut me off when they found out I was seeing her brother, my college friends said if I continue to see him after this summer they're done. I know they're so exhausted with me. I can't talk about him to my family after my abortion. My parents & I have very distant relationships as it is as I was mainly raised by my grandparents. I feel so isolated & alone. I feel like I'm not allowed to feel my emotions. So much has happening over the summer. I got pregnant & had an abortion because he said I was still in school & he didn't want me or my family to feel like he was getting in the way of that. He has 2 kids with 2 different women so I feel like that was the real reason because right after he said he wants to get me pregnant again as soon as I graduate. I got his name tattooed on me just to find out his baby mother & ex girlfriend were arguing with each other on Facebook & his ex has his name tattooed multiple times. That completely broke me it's like I didn't feel special anymore, like everything rose colored went to gray, I didn't eat for 2 days & have been smoking SO much more, barely sleeping, the neurosis is SO bad right now. I sat in my car until 3am last night just sobbing because I feel so stuck & powerless & invested & hating myself, hating how badly I can't let this go. Hating that I'm considering leaving school for him while knowing how little I probably mean to him but hoping I'm wrong & hating that I even have that hope. When I confronted him about it he said he can't help he's well known & that \"old bitches he doesn't want anymore\" still want to fight over him or that someone he knew before me had a tattoo. I told him they wouldn't be arguing if you weren't making them both feel like you was theirs but he swears they just mad they can't have him anymore & that they just want people to know they \"had him\" & that him & his BM broke up over his ex so that's their \"real beef\". I told him that he knew I didn't know about his ex or her tattoos & he said \"you not supposed to! Why are you worried about old stuff? My ex is 5 states away now & I told you I don't talk to my BM outside my kid! You supposed to be my peace why do you think I keep you away from that stuff?\" He went on telling me how I'm young so I'm not mature enough to understand & that I knew the lifestyle he had when I got with him \"of course they'll be girls\" & that I should flex my tattoo because it's obviously a flex if girls he don't want still trying to get clout off of it & that I'll never come around a guy of his caliber so I wouldn't know. I just stopped talking it was like talking to a brick wall. Now I have so much resentment towards him because I can't help but see how manipulative & in control he's in but at the same time I'm so emotionally invested I'm having such a hard time letting go of him. My therapist says I have disorganization attachment (haven't been in a month). I don't want to let go. I can't do regular love. I have a guy back at school begging me to take me on a date & even sent me flowers but I feel nothing. It's too easy & too sweet/mushy. I want to bend & twist & he the most perfect girl for my bf. I never so badly wished I could be a dumb girlfriend that's okay with her man having multiple girls & ignore all the cheating & be okay with a 80/20 power dynamic & just \"play my role\" but I can't. I know that's not healthy & my nervous system is so unregulated I'll drive myself into psychosis. It won't last. But still I'm still considering transferring. I know my family will hate me & I'll be so lonely but at least I'll have him. I know I won't be happy in the end but I want the rush of being his. I don't know what to do I'm so tired.",

My husband has been verbally abusive for years and in the past has tried to hit me , even when I was pregnant. Recently, he told me to leave his house. I left and now live with my parents. Now he's manipulating me, saying he wants me to come back. But I don't feel safe with him. I don't want my son growing up watching a man abuse his mother. I'm scared, confused, and part of me still feels the pressure to \"keep the family together,\" but another part of me knows this is not a healthy or safe environment. Has anyone else been in this situation? How did you find the strength to leave for good and protect yourself and your child?",

    "text": "TLDR: my long term boyfriend has told me to unfriend my closest male friends otherwise he's breaking up with me. my boyfriend and i have been dating long distance for over 18 months now and it's overall been great. he is however quite an insecure and jealous person which he admits to and i'm ok with, however recently it's become too much. he has a number of boundaries; some of which i'd consider valid and others are maybe a bit controlling but that's not the point of this post. most recently he's given me a new boundary about friendships, specifically male friendships. i am in a medium size friendship group with predominantly male friends, and my closest 2 within the group are male. this hasn't seemed to bother my boyfriend too much up until about 6 months ago where'd he'd make comments like 'why don't you just hang with your boys' or 'gonna to complain to your boys about me huh?' which was like the first sign. it's now gotten to a point where they make him so uncomfortable that it drives him crazy and he truly hates them. this month after a week or so of us butting heads about pretty much everything, the topic of my friends came up again. he started once again saying how much he hated the friendships, and long story short gave me the ultimatum that i had to unfriend them otherwise he didn't wanna be with me. at first it was an instant no and i didn't like the idea at all but after much discussion we settled on a compromise which was: i can still talk to them BUT - no one on one hangouts- i can hangout with them only if it's a group setting and only if 1 of the 2 guys are there- not allowed to go to any party they attend- no calling - don't reach out but if they text, be extremely dry - once i graduate (in 2 months) i'm not to see them at all. Now before you say anything i want to let you know that these two friends are quite touchy to the point that sometimes even i need to let them know to tone it down. additionally i had a crush on one of them when i was around 15, and the other makes pretty inappropriate comments around me. regarding the comments i have brought it up with him and he has stopped since then but i thought it was worth mentioning. so normally i would be completely ok with distancing from these two guys because i can see where my boyfriends concerns are coming from but i have some worries. firstly i'm in year 12 and graduating in a couple months; i already have a shit tonne of anxiety around school and removing my current and only support group is terrifying. secondly they are genuinely very loyal and kind hearted fiends, and are currently my ONLY friends, so cutting them out would likely force me to leave the friendship group leaving me alone. thirdly, i'm missing a lot of birthday parties and graduation parties (due to above rules) since they are both going to be attending which just sucks lol. i have already agreed to this compromise and it has so far been 5 days and i am miserable. i feel so alone and disconnected from things that are happening at school, and just today got added to a gc for a friends birthday party that i'm gonna have to not go to. i'm also terrified of graduating with no one by my side, and even more scared for when i'm out of school and i'm not allowed to contact the friends i've had for 6 years. can someone please give me advice? i've tried my best to communicate how i'm feeling to my boyfriend and am gonna try again after i post this but i'm really lost.",

    "text": "So I was in a relationship with the father of my children for 14 years. We are from a small village and occasionally bumped into each other in our late teens, had a kiss at a nightclub when we were about 20. I always felt an incredible attraction to him and found him fascinating. We finally got into a relationship when we were 24 and for some time we were happy. He didn't have the best childhood and had a lot of demons ( I was very naive) he had suffered with addiction before we started dating but while with me he was clean and working. But after having our two children and a number of things going wrong, like him losing his job etc he relapsed and never really recovered apart from the odd few months here and there. When he was in full blown addiction that's when the abuse started happening, emotional mainly but also physical. He's in prison at the moment for climbing through one of my windows and ending up hitting me in front of our kids after he realised I'd rang 999. He smashed up the kitchen and was subsequently arrested and has been in prison for over a year now and due to be released around October/November. What I would like advice on is why do I feel so lost? I'm depressed and I have been diagnosed with ptsd (there's a lot more that has gone on but I'd be here all day explaining) but as I'm in the uk the nhs waiting lists for intense trauma therapy is at least two years. I'm on antidepressants but I've tried many over the last couple of years and none of them seem to do anything. I'm just miserable, I can't help but grieve the life I used to have, how happy I was at one point, having the father of my children in the home. It's weird that I seemed more put together when the abuse was happening and I knew I had to keep it together for the kids sake but I'm just falling apart. If I'm honest being a single parent is so exhausting and I'm constantly stressed. I can't remember the last time I had a good laugh. I thought after this much time apart I would feel stronger but maybe it is because I know he will be out soon. I tried the whole going out thing but that's just not me anymore and it wasn't actually helping it was just numbing the pain for a night. Sorry for the long post and I appreciate any replies. I honestly don't know what to do and I feel like I will never be happy again. I'm just existing.",

    "text": "He had a side woman throughout our marriage. He always protecting her and prioritized her to the point he threw away our marriage for her. She must be on cloud nine. He was abusive about it as well. He made me a punching bag, doormat for all the negative emotions from lying and cheating and channeled all his good sides to her. He made me a punching sack to protect and prioritize her. I tried to have a proper manner and peaceful conversation with him about this so many times, like let's end things in a proper way if he has found his one true love and he's just happened to be in a marriage with the wrong woman, me. All attempts was met with aggressions, blame shifts, suicide threats, more emotional and physical abuse towards me and gaslighted me, even called me schizophrenic and imagining things. I have left for 2 months now and nobody outside knew about this struggle. Only a friend of mine knows how abusive he was. But we aren't the type that like to talk shit or gossip about people. Him on the other side, live for shit talking and smearing. I moved country for him and my life there with him was me assimilated to his life and his circle of friends and work life etc. The scary thing is our job industry (we work in the same industry, including his side woman) works on connections and people tell people kind of thing and I am really worried cause I know for sure he's gonna smeared me backed up by his side woman (probably now gf) especially since that woman is very famous, very influential and working for the big companies in the industry. I feel so much disgusts thinking I knew for sure the moment I left he'd twisted that story so hard and use it to painted me as the villain to everyone there. Also disgusted by how he will portray the side woman. He would pretend that they didn't know each other, he'd be getting so loud and dramatic about how his wife left him 2 months ago, how he would painted me as the evil person and now it's been months since the evil wife left and 'heeey guys look I met an amazing woman who healed me and she's been very supportive about everything meet my new amazing GF' Like barf hard, nobody knows that woman has been there half the marriage and has part in destroying it. And she is not innocent either. she knew he was married and still proceeded with it cause 'life is short' mentality. I knew life has been hard for her, cured from cancer and she's been divorced as well, it's truly hard but I refused to have empathy towards 'life is short and I have suffered, I found my love but he is married but whatever I am gonna grab it cause I deserve it after all I have been through and I might die so just gonna do it while life is short' mindset. I refused to have empathy towards that attitude no matter what she had or hardships she's been through. Maybe I am a cruel person like he said. But if it's me, I won't prioritize myself if I knew I am destroying life, making other's life difficult ,hurting, sacrificing someone else in the process.In anyway I feel so much disgusts, to see that bomb drops. Like the moment he'll make their 'new' relationship public. Acting like they've just met. Nobody knows she is been there more than half of our marriage and have parts in destroying it.",

    "text": "When I first moved into my boyfriend's house, he told me I didn't need to pay him for rent or anything but I didn't feel comfortable with that so I offered to at least split the utilities and we agreed on that. While living here, I've been focusing on my education and because of this, I've had to cut my work hours to part-time. I make roughly $1,500 a month and help with groceries, buy food, do majority of the cooking, and cleaning. My boyfriend doesn't have a job and has no plan of getting a job. I know he's struggling with severe depression and I try my best to help in all the ways I can but he barely helps himself so it makes things difficult. He's home at all times and doesn't go out much, only if it's the two of us. He collects roughly $4k of disability every month so that's how he's able to keep up on his mortgage and most bills. Mind you, he has a history of working and is totally capable of holding a job but has chosen not to work in the past few years. He's put himself into 25k+ worth of debt since quitting his last job and somehow within the past year paid off 20k+ of it (from what he says), but yet he keeps buying unnecessary things and digging himself deeper. A couple days ago, I came home from work and out of nowhere he \"kicked me out\" of the bedroom we share and said I'm no longer allowed to sleep with him at night because he has trouble sleeping with me, and followed with \"If you want to sleep me and take up more space then you need to start paying me rent.\" It turned into a whole argument with him screaming at me saying he's tired of being taken advantage of. This came out of nowhere. It's very confusing for me because he initiated on covering housing costs for me while I focus on my education and all of a sudden wants me to pay $800+ a month. I'm willing to help him out but at the same time something feels off. I'm not on his mortgage or any bills, and I would want to know that my money is going towards his home rather than his debt payments or who knows what else. Should I give start paying him monthly so he stops? I'm willing to go 50/50 and pick up more hours at work but at the same time I'm afraid no matter what I do, his demeanor won't change. TLDR: Moved into boyfriend's house, we agreed I'd split utilities while I focused on school. He has no job, lives on $4k disability, and spends a lot despite debt. Out of nowhere, he kicked me out of our bedroom and said I need to start paying $800+ rent or I can't sleep with him. I'm willing to help financially, but I feel blindsided and worry this is about control, not just money.",

A couple of months into our relationship his ex girlfriend reached out to me on Instagram and told me he physically and emotionally abused her and told me to leave him but I didn't listen to her because I couldn't picture the guy I fell in love with treating me that way. I wish I did listen to her. A couple more months went by and the abuse started and he took control of my entire life. He made me quit my job I loved and still won't let me have one, he took my credit and debit cards and won't let me use them without his permission, he's locked up all my makeup and only lets me use it on date nights but he gets to decide how much I wear, he's made a list of rules I have to follow, I have to do all the chores around the house and I have to buy all the groceries, I'm not allowed to buy anything off the grocery list or anything without asking him for permission first even though it's my money, he poured bleach all over my dad's old Bruins jersey he gave me which is one of the last things I have of him all because dinner wasn't ready as soon as he got home and whenever I have plans with my friends he always supposedly had a surprise date night planned for me at the exact same time so then I have to cancel. If I don't do what he says he'll beat me or destroy something I love or tell me I'm a worthless cunt and I should be lucky he loves me because no guy would want to put up with me. Last night he beat me horribly and just laughed at me when I was crying in pain and struggling to get up and spat on me because I bought a Starbucks drink after I got groceries. I don't like how my life is right now and to be honest I don't even feel like a person anymore really. I just feel like his punching bag and his property and I hate it but I love him at the same time. I probably sound insane for saying that I love him considering how he treats me but I do. We sometimes have really nice date nights together where he'll say I'm pretty and that he loves me and I actually believe it and where he doesn't drink, he'll sometimes let me buy stuff off the grocery list or let me go shopping on my own and every once and awhile he does the house chores and cooks me a nice dinner. I love that side of him so much and it almost outweighs the bad side of him.",

I did do it. But she told me to be careful and that she still cares about me. She often judges me about my mental health, saying im seeking attention, even though i try to keep it as lokey as possible, and when i confront her about it, she says shes just teasing me. She also just does a lot without me that we started doing, like we started watching breaking bad and when i came back the next day she said she binge watched a view episodes. Its okay im not like mad about, i just thought it was our thing. She never wants me to meet her parents, she says its not time yet even though weve been together for about 8 months. It hurts cry sometimes, not because i want to break up, but because im scared that what shes doing is abusive. So i came here to see if im right. Wich i hope im not.

He's even gone as far as to say I'm grounded? Some more info I'd like to add on top of this is that he wants a trad wife that's submissive and sub-servant. He's definitely let me know that I don't meet this category good enough but I'm his responsibility because he took my virginity. He's an \"orthodox Christian\" that has been to church with me once at an Orthodox Church since we've been together. He wants a \"traditional\" lifestyle. I also would like to say that I do have bpd and pcos and due to this he thinks I shouldn't have kids because it will get passed along and because he questions how my parenting will be. SO instead he wants to have polygamy in our relationship with or without my consent. Due to his \"traditional\" values, he wants A LOT of kids and I'm not fitting into that role. I'm also scared to like leave him because he said that most men view women significantly less attractive after 25 and my chances for a lasting relationship after I've slept with one person is extremely low(so basically he's almost my only hope for a love life)! Has anyone experienced abuse like this before? Or anyone that's educated knows what kind of abuse this is? I also need advice if that's possible. 🥲",

    "text": "My boyfriend (31M) and I (31F) have been together almost 2 years. He has a history of being emotionally abusive — minimising my feelings, shutting down when I bring up concerns, and ignoring me in moments I've desperately needed support. The worst was during my miscarriage, when he was basically absent, refusing to see me. This weekend we explored a kink together that was very vulnerable for me. It was emotionally intense, and I really needed closeness and connection afterwards. Instead, he spent nearly the entire weekend gaming and barely acknowledged me. We don't live together so he's only text me maybe 3-4 times. This was a kink he's into. He's really into me degrading him during sex but it feels uncomfortable because outside of sex I am scared to say anything remotely negative towards him. I try during sex but it's really hard, awkward and uncomfortable because of this. Now I'm spiralling, wondering if he's purposefully ignoring me because I wasn't \"good enough\" at what he was into. I know kink isn't supposed to work like that, aftercare is supposed to be important but I feel used, unwanted, and like he only likes me when it's sexual. Then during the night, he woke up in the middle of the night and screamed \"shut the fuck up\" at the top of his lungs because the neighbour was making noise. It really frightened me. He later said he's just so over not having peace and quiet, but the way he exploded left me feeling shaken. In the morning I tried to cuddle and he just wasn't into it. He rolled over onto his phone and said he's was frustrated about buying a house and having no peace. I didn't say anything because in the past, whenever I've brought up feeling hurt or neglected, he's reacted badly defensive, dismissive, or flipping it back on me. I hate conflict, so I swallow it down, but it's eating at me. The truth is I don't even know how to leave this man. I feel stuck. I don't know if I'm overreacting or if I've been conditioned to think this behaviour is normal. I just know I feel sad, disconnected, and like my worth to him only exists in the bedroom.",

My 2 year old and I waited in the car in the parking lot while he went in and ate with his family (it would have been 75$ for all of us). They knew we were sitting in the parking lot because we couldn't afford to come in and they didn't really care, life moved on for them (I don't mind as much for myself but for my child I just don't understand). After getting home I tried to explain how much that hurt me that he would leave us to sit in a car in the parking lot while he went to eat and how much more it hurt that his family knew we were there and didn't even care about our son. This turned into him exploding. He screamed at me up in my face like he was possessed. Defending his actions, justifying that he had done nothing wrong. I ran into a different room because he would not stop. He followed me in, still screaming. I tried to run into my sons room who was asleep at the time saying I was going to get him and just leave, he blocked me from getting to the door but I managed to get in and close it. He tried pushing it open and I told him if he continued I would call 911, he proceeded to say \"go ahead and call them then\". He's never been physical before but at this moment I was SCARED. I knew it was going that direction if this continued, I quickly exited my sons room (left him asleep was trying to make a plan at this point and pack a bag) he followed me screaming that the only reason he mentally and verbally abused me is all my fault and because I make him do it. He loves arguing and thrives off of it so much. He treats me and our older child horribly. Constantly lies, screams, any time we are happy he instantly makes sure he stops that. My daughter has said how scared she is to be happy around him because she knows he will be mean if he sees her smiling. Tonight didn't get physical but it felt like it was about to be. He \"swears\" it would never get to that point but I felt it tonight getting to that point. I felt tonight that the mental and verbal abuse was no longer enough to fuel that fire he desires from it. It's an argument every day that he starts over nothing, just for the love of arguing—that ends in a promise that this will never happen again and he will change and hates the person he has \"become\" (he's been this person for 10 years). Almost every day I hear the same sorry ass excuses and recited apology after the mental and verbal abuse and he does ALL of this in front of the kids. He's wanted to break me and I am fully broken now. I'm trying to muster up what any little bit of strength I do have to try to make a good decision on what to do, what's best to do. I don't know if I'm wanting advice or if I just needed to vent.",

    "text": "When I was younger and still a virgin, I was in a relationship with a guy who pressured me into sex even though I wasn't ready and very scared of it. I had a medical condition that made sex painful, and I told him this many times. He said I needed to be \"broken in\" so I wouldn't feel the pain anymore. He was very good at making it seem like he cared about what I was going through, but the pressure was constant and confusing. He once said, \"If the specialty coffee shop is closed,\" basically meaning me because he thought I was very beautiful, \"then you should go to the one that is cheaper but open.\" In other words, if I wasn't ready for sex, he could just find another \"uglier girl\" (in his own words) who was. Even though he kept saying, \"I don't want you to do this if you're not ready,\" the way he acted didn't match his words. He pushed for sex and certain acts like backdoor sex, even when I said no. Sometimes during sex, he would \"accidentally\" put it somewhere I didn't want even though I would say before the act I don't feel like doing backdoor sex and keep going while I froze. When I would tell him to stop or be upset he would get angry and say \"why didnt you say no, then?\" completely ignoring that I said no before. But these \"accidents\" of putting it in the wrong hole would happen almost everytime and sometimes he would even laugh about it when I would be shocked that he would go somewhere else as if it was some kind of joke. He converted to islam. Once during my period, he said vaginal sex was \"haram\" because of his religion and said we should try backdoor sex and lied about his spiritual coach saying backdoor sex is okay just so he could do it. When I found out he was lying and manipulating me I started crying very very hard. Now that I'm older, I'm trying to understand if this counts as sexual abuse or coercion. Was I being pressured beyond consent? Or am I misreading what happened? I would appreciate any insight as I want to talk about this with my therapist and need some other point of views.",

I am ready to give birth and he comes to tell me that he will never be happy being with me. This all stemed from him finding my underwear in my car....i guess that immediately means im cheating. We got into a full on fight and he left for a while. When he came back home, I went out to talk to him and I asked him if I could live in his house until the baby was born. He told me no. That me being here is just going to make it harder. So now I'm in this pickle. I have to stay in my state because I am on Medicaid. They will only pay for the birth in the state I am registered in. I have no job (I left a week ago) and I have no family where I am living to go stay with. My plan after the baby is born is to move back across the country to be with my parents. But until then I don't know what to do. This is the pattern of him. He tears me down and makes himself the victim. I cry and beg for him to forgive me and he does. I even moved out once and stupidly came back. Now, I can't take it anymore. I can't take the abuse and I don't want to put my son through it. I will be birthing alone now and I will be raising a child alone. My heart breaks but I have no choice. I've done everything to try to please this man and I now realize it will never be enough. Has anyone experienced something similar? I plan to call medicaid but can it transfer to another state? Do I go live in a shelter for 4 weeks until I give birth? I can't afford the 2k hotel bill at the moment.",

So my boyfriend of 2+ years last night had been touching me inappropriately and it woke me up but I still pretended to be asleep and eventually he stopped and then I just fell back asleep I woke up in the morning and I had woken up before him so I felt like I should look on his phone because the way he was touching me was just unusual and I just had a feeling so I looked on his phone and he had been recording what he was doing to me, I was obviously shocked but I didn't know what to do so I just put his phone down, I've been fine with him all day but I've just been thinking like why would he be recording me like that for no reason and he fell asleep again and hour ago so I decided to go back on it and do more digging and I've found that for a while he's been sending our s3x tapes to people on twitter to post aswell as indecent photos of me and followed by those videos I found on his phone of him touching me in my sleep aswell as lots of DMs of things also about me. All I could think to do was to take videos of what I've found and hide them in my phone. He's laying right next to me rn sleeping and I have no idea how to feel or what to do please help. I really don't have the balls to even say anything I just really don't know what to do.",

    "text": "Me (22F) him (23M). We have been together about 2 years. We have had problems all throughout our relationship with him trusting me and accepting my past experiences with sex considering he had none and I was his first. He is a very jealous, possessive person especially with me. We have had instances of mental/physical abuse. Mostly mental abuse but he has slapped/ hit me before. Not to extreme cases but it has happened. Besides that our other issues involve him not having his life together and I feel like I am overall more emotionally mature. I would never dump somone over financial struggles however that on top of abuse with the empty promises of change have me feeling like I should not stay in this relationship. We have gotten in a horrible fight last week, he crossed many of my boundaries and broke a few promises he said he would never do again. I feel like I am strapped in a horrible cycle and I have been threatening to break up, ever since then he has been making noticeable changes. Like last week he just started his job from not having one for a year of our relationship. He is also exercising, and agreed to start therapy (he starts going next week). I am proud of the changes he is making to keep me in his life and preserve the future we both want with each other, However as much as I love him to death I am afraid that even though he is changing, I will not be able to move on from the things he has done. We have not seen each other In person for nearly a week and half and I constantly feel like I want to cry when I think about what he's done to me. I am genuinely lost and confused and trauma bonded. I don't wanna lose the love of my life, or have him be perfect for the next girl in his life. That would break my heart. I feel like I am being unfair to him because I have not been able to make my mind up on staying or leaving. I feel terrible because he's so willing to put the work in. But all I feel is fear of even seeing him again. He only gets aggressive with me when the topic is around sex, or my past relationships. He has never done anything to me for any other reasons. I would appreciate anyone's help/advice, especially a male POV, I want to know if he being truthful or if I'm not being honest with myself :( I don't know why I feel so guilty when he is the one that harmed me!!",

I've woke up once with cuts all over my body including inside my ear. And most recently I was burned with what appears to be the tip of a lighter that we use to light candles with, I know this by the shape of the lighter tip and the burn match up exactly. have also been awake and my husband rolled over and just yanked my hair and when I said something he said sorry. Because of that I think he may be behind it. So I got this app called Snore Lab and it records you while you sleep. And in a few of the recordings when he rolls over you can hear me moan out like I'd been hurt and of course I have a bruise like on my inner thigh that looks like pinch marks or finger tips!! I'm at a loss and my next step is to get a hidden camera to get to the bottom of it. I have taken pictures of everything and documented everything!! Anyone else have a similar experience?? Also he has had sex with me before while I slept and he thinks it's ok. But I told him it's rape. He just doesn't see anything wrong with it. There's more to the story, ask if you wanna know more.",

I think my already emotionally abusive partner is drugging me and doing something to me while I'm asleep. There's a lot more context to that like how I went through his photos on his phone and found pictures of me asleep naked without me knowing. Missing underwear. Mysterious bruises on my legs and sometimes I wake up to my throat and jaw hurting really bad. Or even random vomiting. He had all his exes nudes/sex tapes still in his phone and I suspect he was sending it to his friends. But he caught me looking and changed his passcode and likely deleted this evidence. He's onto to me. He's getting more desperate to reach me and last times we broke up he found ways to contact me anyway. Do I go to the police? Because I've been trying to get someone to test my hair all day and no one seems able to provide me with a dv advocate or a sane nurse either. I'm going crazy calling every hotline because they keep giving me dead end advice. I need a solid plan to get his stuff back to him safely. do I go to the cops and press charges? Do I just file a restraining order? Do I go back to the er that denied me a sane nurse and demand one? Do I save a hair sample myself now to be tested later? I'm at a loss at what to do next and in what order.",

I still have flashbacks and am haunted by everything that happened, daily. But I got away. I escaped from this evil motherfucker, and for the first couple months, I felt guilty, like I did something wrong. He's in jail, looking at almost 30 years for what he did to me. I'm not participating in the case, but there is enough evidence, and he's a habitual offender, that its likely he will do years, even if not 30. He beat the fuck out of me & choked me out more times than I can count. Almost killed me.. Cheated, twisted my mind, did me dirty in every way. I have ptsd and minor brain damage from all the times... I'm having our baby in 3 or so weeks. He tried to beat her out of me, too. He really wanted to kill her, and me. He said I wasn't worthy to have his baby.... after we had been trying for years. I tried to forgive him but I don't know that i will ever be able to. He will never meet her, unless she goes looking for him one day, his name won't be on any paperwork, and she will never know the fucking terror we lived thru. Im scared he'll try to find us one day but i have faith we will be okay. I cut all contact with him 2 months ago, and the fog lifted. For years, I ignored every red flag. I forgave, and did everything I could to be the perfect wife. It took me a long time to realize I could not have been perfect enough to make him love me, not hurt me. He almost fucking killed me, and our baby. I tried so hard to love him well and he destroyed me. I'm a little nervous, I know she's gonna look just like him. But she'll be perfect, and good, and she isnt him. I just know when I see her, the memories will flood in of him. I hope not too much. Just rambling, really. Maybe this will give somebody hope that you can leave too, that everything works out, slowly but surely sometimes, and the creator cares what you are going thru. I got away. And im still haunted by what I thought it was, what it could have been, what it really was. I lost everything, my home, my car, my family, my sanity, my career & job. but I've gained almost everything back, and what I haven't gotten back yet I know will come to me in perfect time. I feel so blessed. The tragedy of all the bullshit still plays in my mind daily, but the universe helped me in ways I couldn't even fathom, and im still alive, more myself than ive ever been.If anyone is out there reading this, you can do it. There is more for you, life is meant to be good. A man who is okay hurting you & twisting your mind, does not love you, no matter how you think they do. I believe in you, & the universe has your back. You can do this.",

We met on bumble and I was always hesitant to meet people in person on there. After a month of texting back n forth he finally convinced me to see him. It felt like an instant spark and we continued to hang out. I am a very extroverted person so I already had a lot of plans when we first started talking so I couldn't give him as much time as he wanted and would frequently get upset about that. (Should've been major flag number one). But I ignored it because of the instant connection I felt with him. He used to call me all hours of the night and wake me up and I would always answer. Within a week he trauma dumped on me over the phone about his ex wife and even though I answered at 4am and was there for him he ended up yelling at me over the phone and calling me a narcissist. I didn't even know what a narcissist was at this time. I woke up confused and feeling like I didn't want to talk to him ever again. He flooded my phone with calls and texts telling me how sorry he was and that he's just \"traumatized\" from his last relationship and I felt bad for him and like I said I still felt like we had such a good connection I decided to move forward. We have been off and on for about a year because he will be the most amazing person I've ever met for a week or two sometimes will even go a month and then out of nowhere will have these violent yelling outbursts. And then after would apologize and tell me he wanted it to work and would persuade me to come back. Come to find out he has been MARRIED. He kicked me out of his house so she could come back and still tried to make it work with me promising me up and down he was going to get a divorce. Never happened. He made so many false promises and always had something bad to say about me. I tried to get away from him so many times but he always lured me back in. He finally hurt me physically the other night by punching me in the face and body slamming me into the ground. He saw a guy I used to talk to text me and kept saying I had been cheating on him the whole year even though this man HAD A WHOLE ASS WIFE AT HOME. I wasn't cheating. I think he just got way to in over his head trying to make it work with both of us. Anyways, I called the cops but he fled. I have him blocked and idk what the outcome is going to be but I'm so just mad at myself for believing his lies. I've almost lost my job and a lot of friends over this man. I can't believe people like this exist.",

    "text": "I never thought I'd be in this position—having to write this out to strangers online because the people in my life refuse to listen. But here I am, because I need someone—anyone—to hear me and believe me. I'm a survivor of domestic abuse. My ex manipulated, gaslit, and emotionally harmed me repeatedly. There were constant put-downs, moments of public humiliation, and attempts to control how I expressed myself or who I spoke to. I was degraded and dismissed, and when I tried to leave, he twisted the narrative and made me out to be the aggressor. Recently, I confronted him in a public setting after learning he was talking badly about me—again. I stood up for myself, angry and hurt, but I never laid a hand on him. Still, I was the one removed from the community group. I was accused of being the problem. The person who hurt me got to play victim, and people believed it. Some even defended him, including someone I thought was my friend—someone who's now dating him and refusing to hold him accountable. The worst part? My own parents don't believe me. My mother called me a \"snowflake\" and said I should just \"move on.\" When I mentioned I had reported what happened to event security, they said I went too far. It feels like I'm being punished again—first by the person who abused me, and now by the people who are supposed to protect me. I'm so tired. I've done everything I thought I was supposed to do. I tried to stay quiet. I tried to let it go. I tried to be \"civil.\" But I'm done carrying the shame for something I didn't cause. I'm sharing this here because I know some of you have been through this. I know some of you understand what it's like to be silenced, gaslit, and shunned by your own support network. I'm trying to rebuild my strength, possibly even start a support group for others like me—somewhere safe, where survivors can speak without fear of being dismissed or blamed. If you've been through something like this—if you know this kind of pain—please tell me I'm not alone.",

    "text": "First off, I know the answer is usually \\\"talk to him and tell him how you feel.\\\" Well, I tried that. My boyfriend and I have been together for almost two years. I love him more than anything, and besides this problem, we're perfect. I fell for him because he's such a rational and logical person. The problem is, all of his past girlfriends have been the epitome of jealous, CRAZY, and controlling and it has conditioned him to believe that controlling = loving and true love means you spend 100% of your time together and friends don't matter. Whenever I get angry, before I start a fight, I try to sit down and rationalize the situation. I say to myself, \\\"is it rational for me to be angry? If I were my boyfriend, would I think my anger is rational?\\\". In his case, he lets his jealousy and emotions control his rational thought. He gets upset that I want to do things that don't involve him and starts fights or guilt trips me every time I do. One thing he said was that it makes him upset that I make plans with other people without clearing it with him first. I love him, but he's not my mom and I don't need to get permission to do things. I tried telling him, but he won't understand what I'm saying. He just says things like 'if you love me, you should want to spend more time with me, not other people.' I love him, but when he acts controlling and crazy, I fall slightly out of love with him. I want to be with him, but it's stressful having to deal with a fight LITERALLY EVERY TIME I spend time with friends. I'm very close to breaking up with him, but I don't want to end an otherwise perfect relationship. How do I make him realize he's being controlling?",

    "text": "Sorry about the formatting, I'm on my phone. I'm (F 21) starting to think my boyfriend (M 21) is too controlling. I've lived with my boyfriend for almost a year now and We've been together, in total, about 2-2½ years. We've been having a lot of arguments on the topic and my family thinks he's too controlling. I've made a list of some of the things I think might be too much and I'm not sure what do to. There are more but these are the bigger ones.  We've had a talk about it more recently and he justifies them because I often lie and do things behind his back, so I can't be trusted. The numbering in the list has no significance. 1 ) I have to tell him when I drink coffee or get an energy drink because he doesn't want me to get addicted to caffeine. He justifies this because my mom drinks a lot of energy drinks. 2 ) I can't smoke nicotine at all. Doesn't want me to get addicted. 3 ) I can only smoke my medical Marijuana once a month, at most. Doesn't want me to get addicted. When we weren't living together, I didn't have to tell him at all. I smoked every night for sleep and occasionally for fun or panic attacks. Then I had to talk to him about smoking if it wasn't for sleep. We broke up for a bit and one of his terms for getting back together was that I couldn't smoke more than once a month. 4 ) I can't smoke with other people unless he says he's okay with it. 5 ) I have to ask him if I can drink but he's okay with it multiple times a week. 6 ) I can't wear short shorts or an exposed shirt. Tight pants or shirts are cutting it close. I can't be too exposed if I leave the bedroom at all. I prefer he not leave the room shirt/pant-less when the roommate's gf is around. 7 ) I can't make any purchases without consulting him first and making sure he's okay with it. I ask that if he expects that of me, I want the same; I get told about his purchases most of the time. He wants to make sure I'm saving enough money to pay off his student loans when he gets out of college. 8 ) I have to tell him when I leave the house and where I'm going; but I expect the same from him. 9 ) If I leave the room, and he asks, I have to tell him where I'm going and what I'm doing. If I'm going to be gone for longer than a handful of minutes, I have to tell him without being asked. I told him that I'm not okay with telling him what I'm doing in the bathroom when I go to the bathroom. I said that as long as he expects that of me, I expect that of him 10 ) I can't talk to other people about us or our arguments. Venting isn't valid and my opinions should come from me, not outside influences.  11 ) If I've done something he thinks was wrong, I have to apologize. It doesn't count if I took too long to do it, if he had to prompt me for it, or if it doesn't seem like I mean it. 12 ) He says he's justified in doing things like, going through my messages, looking at my bank transactions, drug testing me, and other various things along those lines, because I have a history of lying and doing things without telling him. He gets angry when I say it feels like I have to ask permission to do things because I don't need to ask permission, he's entitled to being upset. I say he is entitled to feeling upset but his behavior is more than just feeling upset. We'll argue about it for hours, he'll get very angry, he'll want to go through my stuff and get angry if I don't want him to. He'll start talking about breaking up or taking a break, which is usually just all the same restrictions but less affection. He'll say he's not comfortable saying \"I love you\" back and doesn't want to answer when I ask if that means he dosen't love me anymore. Last time he said he didn't love me, I said I didn't want to answer certain questions because I didn't feel comfortable being so vulnerable with someone who didn't even love me; I think that's why he's stopped straight up saying he doesn't love me and does that instead.",

I never show my belly, my tits or my ass, but I tend to like clothes that fit my figure. The last argument we had was over this dress (took the pic out for privacy) which he says is too tight and that if I decide to wear this dress it means I'm disrespecting him. I'm really getting very tired of his irrational restrictions, because I honestly don't see anything wrong with that dress. It's a nice summer orange dress. But anytime my curves are even slightly outlined, he gets mad and cannot stand it. I tried to explain to him that I'm not a man and that I don't want to look like a man, I want to dress in a way I get to feel feminine without being vulgar. I wanted to get some external opinion about it, is this dress too revealing as he insists to be? His insecurities also went to other areas of my life, such as males I hang out with, and such. I stopped posting pics on social media and stopped talking to male friends, but his impositions never stop and I'm getting tired. He also turns the tables against me saying I'm a conflictive person for not submitting to all he demands from me. What do you think?",

I love him so much and I know he loves me and would never actually hurt me, he's also the hottest guy ever in my opinion which is a plus. He's always been a more aggressive type of guy and likes to be in control. He really likes picking my outfits and choosing what I eat for some reason. I'm not sure if other guys do this but I think this is just something he personally likes to do. He only has me eat healthy food which is good for me so I don't care about that. He likes me to spend all of my time with him, if I'm not with him, I'm just at home which I kind of like because I'm very introverted and I don't have many people to hang out with anyways. In the beginning of our relationship he had a tracker because of stuff that happened in his past relationships but later on he took it off because we trust each other. Also, he likes to kind of take his fetishes outside of the bedroom and will grab my arm or wrist really tight or pull my hair, (not painfully hard) just for fun. Whenever I don't look at him while I'm talking to him, he'll grab my face, squeeze it, and pull it towards where I'm looking at him face to face. I feel like a lot of this might be weird to some people but that's just part of his personality and what he likes. One day when my older sister came over without notice, she saw one of the bruises on my arm and cheek. I told her there wasn't anything to worry about and that we are just kinky in bed but I could tell it made her feel weird and I feel kind of bad about it.",

For example, I started a new job at this place and my bf got so upset when one of my colleagues gave me the company's merch as a welcome gift. This is actually a common practice in the company and I tried explaining it to my bf but he was so pissed at me. Next, he would get so angry if I change something about myself like once I went to the hair salon to get highlights. I wanted a chestnut brown highlights but somehow the hairdresser made it too yellow and light so it was close to blonde. I was pretty upset with how my highlights turned out but I just laughed it off and thought, it's alright, I will have fun with this colour for a week or two before I dyed it to a different colour. When I FaceTimed my bf that evening, he was so pissed. Not at the hairdresser but at me for purposefully dying my hair blonde. I swear it wasn't on purpose. I didn't choose blonde. I asked for chestnut brown. And then, he would get so upset with me going somewhere. For example, I love going to the gym. I would just walk on the treadmill or weightlift some lightweights stuff because it makes me happy. I used to be a big girl and going to the gym has helped me a lot to shed those weights and battle with my depression. And my bf, wouldn't even let me go to the gym. He would call me when I'm at the gym so many times and ask me why did I go there and he would get so upset. His reason was because he would get jealous if I go to the gym and people could see me and he's afraid if I would fall for someone there. He is so suspicious of me. One time, half an hour before my exam starts, my bf actually called to share screen my instagram account because he suspected that I was having an affair with a fake follower: it was a fake follower. I didn't even know who that person is. And then he said he trusts me but his mom influenced him to think I was going to cheat on him. I didn't do anything to raise any kinds of the suspicion. I have always been loyal to him. I love him. I would call him every time during my lunch hour and fly to him during my vacation days. The thing is, these are a few little incidents that has happened. So many crazier things had happened but it's too lengthy for me to explain it here. Recently he started the gym (it's been about two months or so now) but I started to resent him because I've left doing so many things for him. I've sacrificed doing the thing that I love because of him. Because he asked me to. And I've gained weight too because of it. I haven't moved around as much. I'm just constantly doing everything for him, from not going to the gym to not getting lash extensions. This might seem very small and silly but these little things gives me joy and I stopped doing that because he was always picking fights with me whenever I do so. So I stopped. But now he's going to the gym and loving it and I hate that he is doing the things he love but stops me from doing them. And when I cry and bring it up, he said \"then go to the gym\" or \"why do you always bring up about the past whenever you look at me\". I still love him and wants the best for him. But I hate that he has no remorse or feels sorry for basically stopping me from doing the things I love for the past one year and pretended like it's not his fault. Why do I feel this way? What's wrong with me? Is controlling someone normal in a relationship? Is resentment normal?",

    "text": "Sorry if i don't do this right but i've never really used reddit, mostly just watched rslash. And for some background info, i knew all my friends before i met him but they go to an all guys private school together. Most of my friends go to that school with him so i understand that it can be different if i am hanging out with other guys, but i've been nothing but loyal and he knows and likes most of these people, 70% of them being gay. this story takes place in the city however a couple months ago i moved from where i was which was about 2 hours away to the city. I'm 16f and my boyfriend is turning 17. When we first got together about 9 months ago we were always like really extreme with how we spoke etc like, we never fought or anything but it was constantly just \"i love you\" or \"i need you\" constantly. He slowly introduced things into our relationship that i wasn't sure about but when he would say it he would be flustered saying i would think he was weird and i wanted to reassure him. some of these things are, - naming my stomach and asking for pictures of her, saying how beautiful she is and wanting to kiss her. (non sexual) - saying i have to ask to make plans with friends, ie - i cant say \"me and james are going shopping\" i have to ask \"is it okay if me and james go shopping\" and he's allowed to say no. - speaking in a baby talk like the \"owo wuts dis\" and calling me mummy. (non sexual). theres probably more but i cant think of them. a couple weeks ago, maybe 3, i sat on the phone with my best friend who goes to school with him and we typed a massive paragraph together on a google doc for me to finally send to him. earlier that week i had asked if my friend bianca who lives about 2 hours away, could sleep over. his immediate reaction was that \"he wanted to be the first person to sleep in my bed\" and kept bringing up her sleeping in my bed with me not saying anything besides can she sleep over. he then said that she was \"a stranger to him\" and he wouldnt be okay with us sleeping together. this is a girl i used to go to school with before i moved, so it wouldnt make sense that he wouldve met her before. we had an argument and he insisted that he didnt do anything wrong and he said \"i make paramount sacrifices for you and i want you to do the same again\". the text i sent him mentioned issues on our codependency, something about how he will send me up to 50 texts until i respond if im with my friends and gets upset that im busy, how i dont like how i have to text him every 30 minutes, how i feel he's controlling and i feel very isolated from my friends, and how uncomfortable i was with the stomach thing and the baby speak thing i mentioned before. the conversation went really well with him saying yes he's controlling and acknowledging all the things he does and apologising. this happened on thursday. on friday i go to their school when they finish class to see my friends, and ultimately meet back up with my boyfriend and go to my place with him. the day went very well with him only texting me a few times and making me feel secure that i dont have to be panicked about a fight just for seeing people who aren't my boyfriend. on saturday my girlfriend from my old school came to sleep over and we spent the day out and went to a refugee protest and had a really good time, with him still not blowing up. at about 12:30 we watch a movie and during the movie he starts doing it again. texting me over and over. asking so many questions like \"when does the movie and? what time are you going to bed? what are you doing? hey whered you go come back?? why arent you texting me?\" and non stop buzzing making everyone annoyed at me. i got upset and said that he said this wouldnt keep happening and he argued with me until 2:30 ending in me crying with my friend. i would just like to say rn i like being texted and checked up on while im out, im not a stone cold person or anythibg, and i do the same to him, except hes so obsessive when he does it and gets angry at me. all i want, and ive told him this so many times, is a few simple texts like \"i love you, hope youre having a good time :)\". the next day he was blowing up my phone pretty much the entire time and after a week or two everything we had talked about was back. now everytime ive gone out with my friends or even just going shopping/getting dinner with my mom he sends me upwards of 30 texts. last friday i saw two of my friends after school. one friend took a photo of me and the other guy together with me kinda lifting my leg up as a joke, and he didnt touch me but where his hand was it looked sort of like it was on my breast, again it wasnt at all and when i say that i just mean like kinda placed in front, not grabbing it in an overtly sexual way. anyway my friend took the photo and we went on with our day. my boyfriend had already been texting a lot but when he saw that photo he sent me 43 messages within about 7 or 10 minutes. i was crying while my friends tried to tell me not to reply and i did anyway apologising profusely. some of the messages he sent were \"fuck you. you do nothing for this relationship. i dont regret a single thing ive said. im so fucking over this shit. i am beyond fucking angry. you should feel fucking awful\" ending with him saying i had to leave my friends right now which i did, and saw him. he spent about an hour telling me how unfair it was how i havent been me lately, threatening to break up with me because it doesnt matter to me, saying i should be glad he texts me like that because he cares, so much stuff. im still just crying and just agreeing with everything hes saying when my mom calls me. he can hear my voice but not hers and i manage to tell her without him realising that im really upset and my boyfriend has done something. after 30 more minutes in the really cold dark he finally lets us walk back to where there's light and hes very cuddly and saying sorry after it was all \"sorted\". everyone who ive talked to about him and this says i should leave him but its not that easy. he is so obsessive i just need someone to understand i cant do that and he would just accept it. anytime ive asked to talk to him beforehand he has made me promise im not breaking up with him. i just need help. none of the things hes doing and saying to me will stop and i feel so alone. its only getting worse and worse. i really dont want to leave him, i love him and hes seen every part of me, but i need this ro change and i dont know what else i can do.",

    "text": "I thought I would take my own personal experience to share what are now obvious red flags that my boyfriend was controlling and would ultimately lead to abuse but at the time I saw them as either romantic, endearing, and often I thought that if he was mad about something, it had to be my own fault altogether. The in-your-face signs of control and potential abuse are all over the internet, but some other examples are not. Please also note, if you find similarity in any of my experiences listed below, it does not necessarily indicate the potential for abuse if looked at individually and within context. However, lumped together and in patterns, it could be a signal that something is wrong. To further preface, these happened earlier on in the relationship and without overt abuse or intimidation. He always defended everything as him just loving me so much. (Hard to be mad at, right?). - My BF always wanted me to go to bed with him. Whether I was tired or not. If I wanted to stay up, he didn't like it and made it seem that he just wanted to be near me. And often, if I got up in the middle of the night to get a drink or because I couldn't sleep, he would get up, as well to check on me. - He always wanted to shower with me. If I went in before him or waited until he was completely done before getting in, he either expressed disappointment or otherwise insisted we shower together. - Early on, my BF made us matching bracelets. If mine broke, he would make me another. Seems like a nice thing, right? But looking back, I feel like it was his way to mark me as his. If I took it off, he would take it personally. - He would get upset if I would leave the room unexpectedly. I recall one time, he was drawing with pastels on the floor and I was reading on the couch. I decided to get up and go upstairs to grab the laundry. We actually fought about this because he thought I should have been thoughtful enough to stay with him the entire time he decided to draw in silence. After all, he loved my company. - He would get upset if I changed my plans that had nothing to do with him. For example, before we lived together, if I told him I was going to the store on my way home, but then changed my mind, he would see that as not 'keeping my word' about what I told him I planned to do. - In the gym, when we worked out separately, he would always look for me wherever he was in the gym at the time. I would always catch him searching in the mirror or around the room until he found me, as if he was always trying to keep track of my whereabouts. If we did work out together, he pouted if I didn't do the exact same exercises, sets, and reps that he did. - My BF wanted to do EVERYTHING with me. Nothing was too boring or routine. He just wanted to be with me. - There was great anxiety around my phone. Sound notifications. Light notifications. All of it made him uneasy to the point that he didn't even want to look at or touch my phone. He claimed that he was just afraid of losing me to someone else. There are probably more, but you get the gist. You can see how many of these things appear loving and romantic, especially in the beginning. I often thought some of these were unreasonable and unfair to me, or just 'off'. But then I always felt like the jerk about feeling that way because he defended his actions by saying he only wanted to spend time with me/missed me/felt anxious, etc....right??? That was always the spin that made me second guess myself! But it's not okay for someone to use their pain to automatically make you the person in the wrong. Constant understanding, constant empathy, constant giving in with no reciprocation is akin to walking on eggshells. If your SO does any of the above but makes you feel bad about it when you push back instead of respecting your space or communicating to you about it in a healthy way, please reassess your relationship. These were markers early on that I dismissed as sweet and caring, rather than controlling or possessive, and it did escalate. Remember, not all signs of control and abuse are as black and white as most people think. Catch the signs early before you're in too deep and go with your gut.",

    "text": "I wore a crop top out with a group of friends and when my bf later saw a photo of us he asked if that is what I wore out. I said yes, and he said that me dressing like that made him uncomfortable. I tried to explain to him that he can't control what I wear, but he counters with \"do you not care that it makes me uncomfortable?\". He asked why I dress like that \"when I know guys will want me\" when I do. I told him I want to wear what I think is cute. Or comfortable. Or whatever I want to wear. I tried explaining that men that harass women will harass women. No matter what they're wearing. I've been harassed in sweatpants and a sweatshirt. It doesn't matter. He has commented about my clothing choices to other events, too, saying I am knowingly dressing so that guys will say/think those things about me. I've told him that my own boyfriend is the last person I want objectifying me, and it's the worst feeling. I posted a picture of myself on my story the other day and he said all of the same things and much worse saying I did it for attention. I pointed out that he had a recent post of a handful of photos of him. Just different pictures of him in an outfit. I posted just that. A picture of myself. He said it is completely different. It is not. I don't want to have to worry about people judging me and having those thoughts about me, especially from him. He says he doesn't want to be with someone who does that. I asked if by \"does that\" he means dressing how I want. He said yes. I told him he cannot control what I wear. He asked if I were serious and meant that. Saying it's messed up of me to dress however I am because it makes him uncomfortable. Lots of other details but another main point is that he was essentially saying that what men say to me is because of what I wear. So I asked if girls who get raped did because of their clothes. He said that's not the same. Spent a while breaking it down and explaining that it is, in fact, the same ideology. The same pipeline. Not that it matters but the other outfit he was upset about literally had two inches of skin showing. Besides my head and hands. Not that that holds any weight, just makes it even more outlandish and frustrating. I love him and I don't want to break up with him but I can't be with him if he \"needs\" to control what I wear. Extra embarrassing when a friend asks why I didn't wear my cute new shirt and I have to answer with, \"my boyfriend said I can't wear it.\" How do i get it through his head that it's not my fault that men say/think gross things. Because it's not.",

    "text": "Recently gone through what i think might be a discard…i have previously been with a narcissist and then went into a new relationship and I think he might be an abusive narcissist too but my brain is so scrambled I keep wondering if it was all my fault and im narcissistic and abusive and made him break up with me. an important note is he got me kicked out of the community we were living I'm after he broke up with my by his friends who are leaders there, when I was having a days long panic attack after his horrible and confusing treatment of me finally ending with him breaking up. I didn't know where to go and they forced me out while I was physically shaking and crying and I told them he had been drinking and was being horrible to me recently. Important note to add is I discovered his vodka bottle a day or two before him discarding me, I was kind and loving about it but also said it affected me as he lied about it and would tell me it was water and made me feel horrible for being suspicious. But yes day after me confronting him about the alcohol (I thought he had been sober for a while) he got rid of me , and didn't think his relapse should affect me. Examples of his behaviour include I saw on his phone a message from his ex who had made me feel very uncomfortable and almost stopped me even continuing to date him (shouldn't have probably!) and he told me he wasn't talking to her anymore. So when I saw the message my heart dropped but I didn't want to assume anything so when I went quiet he asked what was wrong and I calmly said I saw the message from her and felt a bit weird and confused.we were in the car driving and then immediately he began shouting at me and berating me for 30 minutes straight , I didn't reply to anything he said i didn't want to fuel it then he got angrier at me for not saying anything. It was non stop. Saying things like \"fine the day is ruined we can't ever have a nice day we I'll turn the car around and you can go and put your head in your hands and cry in a dark room ! \"blah blah i tried to tune out i was scared and then he was saying things like \"you can be in a relationship with me if you want but having a relationship with my exes is a non negotiable and it's normal and its healthy and i don't even like calling them my exes\" it was horrible.Then i said its not okay to yell at me and he just said he didn't shout at me he is just a loud person and raised his voice a bit and he was fustrated because if I trusted him I would have feelings about these things. I said you definitely did shout and eventually he admitted it. Then I said i got out the car we went to a park and I was ready to break up. I just stayed silent and felt completely emotionally withdrawn. Then he curled up on the ground and wouldn't talk and then started crying saying there's something wrong with him and he wants to die but I shouldn't be comforting him , which i was because I was distressed to see this. I don't know doesn't feel right.Other things that make me question if he's a narc is what I think was triangulation , on our first date we went to a park and this girl came over he met once and they talked for quite a while I wasn't part of the conversation. Then he said how cool and funny she was and how he wanted to hang out with her because she would be fun to hang out with. I was completely confused and went quiet. After a while he asked \"oh are you upset about what I said about that girl?\" i said yea i felt weird about it and he said he is just a very complimentary person . But it felt weird. And he often dropped the exes name who the message was from the felt unnatural.towards the end he was just horrible, saying he can't be in a relationship with me unless I get therapy and I don't love or look after myself. One time he was being horrible and I was crying and said \"your being really mean\" and he just said , \" yea, I am being mean\" in an aggressive way. He would get angry at me for being upset and tell me I ruined his days. he didn't check to see if I found somewhere to go or if I was okay after getting me kicked out. He said he nothing to do with me being kicked out and I was being unfair and hurting him and villifying him when I was upset at how he'd treated me then got me kicked out and isolated from all my friends. He was crying and being a victim and his friends said they were protecting him from me.There's so much I can't write it all. But still I feel scared I am the narc and abusive and its my fault. But all my friends say he is a very horrible narcissistic person. he told me he needs to work on himself and I do too and he needs to prioritise himself for once. And that he doesnt want any regrets and was just talking about himself the whole time, and that I would be fine and that his addiction had nothing to do with our problems.another thing he did was threaten to call an ambulance on me when I had a panic attack and wake up his friends then I was begging him not too and then he said \"you only think of yourself i need the ambulance for myself i need to wake up my friends to support me I'm having a panic attack now and this isn't normal\" i dont know i feel crazy. I have nightmares every night and constantly feel panicky. I'm the beginning he was so lovely and generous and empathic and kind and said d he wanted to marry me and do all these things with me. im confused if it was love bombing and he's a narc or I Pushed him too far with asking for reassurance and talking about when Im triggered or having low mental health and asking for too much support or something … he also message my friend behind my back and told her not to tell me and she barely knows him and he said he was worried he was getting into another co dependant relationship and I was always anxious without him and just really in depth oversharing and when she told me I confronted him and he said she betrayed him and he wouldn't let her or her partner come back to the community even though they are my friends and he kept saying how uncomfortble he was around her and she betrayed him but I should have and did feel betrayed by him but when I said that I was guilted so stopped. I dont know tell me what you think is he abusive and narcissistic i don't know if I was being abusive or it was him I'm so confused",

    "text": "I've been with my partner for 4 years. I met him when I was 19 and will be 24 this year. This whole abuse thing happened when he started asking about previous partners. He doesn't like the fact that I've been with more people than him and that these partner were older than me. He labels me as a hoe and every single horrid name under the sun. The abuse is awful. He bases my worth on that alone. He's told me that he lost love and his opinion on me changed after knowing about my past. He treats me horrible and has been bullying me constantly about it for the 4 years we have been together. He blames me for his mental health issue because of this. There is not doubt he has mental health issue but I am not the cause of this. He says I am the reason he likes to drink and smoke his life and take drugs, all I've ever done is try to help him. He threatens to hurt these people I've previously been with and has actually done it before. He does things on purpose to trigger me like belittle me by calling me these horrible names because he knows it will cause me distress. I mean 4 years of being called a hoe, a slag, dirty etc etc it will become a trigger. I've had to beg to not call me these names, and he continues until I'm sat there crying having a panick attack… I ask him to leave and he doesn't. He leaves during me having panick attacks, then does not check up on me and ghosts me. He will then claim he loves me and u probably already know the rest. He swears up and down he will change and won't do this shit but 2 days later he does the same. I've seen things about how to deal with a narc like not playing into their emotional needs and shit like that… it's kind of working?? I don't know. I need to get out but I don't know how. He's ruined my life, he won't leave me alone even those he claims to sometimes hate me and thinks the worst of me. He will never hear me out about how bad he is making me feel. He will alway switch it and make it about him. I can't control my past, I can't do anything about. But he will blame me for how he's feeling, because of me being with other people before I ever even knew he was a fucking person. I can't live my life like this anymore. He's ruining me as person, I have no social life anymore, nothing. He makes life about him and how he's the victim. Everything bad in his life is because of him and he won't ever take accountability. Has Anyone else dealt with this? How do I get out? Can the relationship be fixed?",

    "text": "I'm writing this to seek validation- I'm not sure whether my situation qualifies as NA or just a really shitty situation. I'm about 8 months post-breakup from a 3 year relationship. We met working at a school and I had a HUGE crush on him before we started hooking up- I thought he was so sweet, smart, thoughtful. He had this image of being incredibly sensitive and justice oriented. When we started dating I was over the moon and couldn't believe I landed my crush. He was very recently out of another relationship and said he wanted to keep things \"casual,\" because we were also coworkers at the time. I was okay with this, but within weeks we were spending over 24 hours together every weekend. He started asking me on dates, talking to me about our families, etc., so I felt we were on the same page about really liking each other and things progressing beyond casual. After 6 months of this, we had a super romantic week- we went on a hike together and he told me how much he liked me and wanted to keep seeing me. This is when the cycle started. 2 days after that, we were out in public and I put my arm around him. Later, he freaked out and said \"When I said I liked you I meant just as a friend.\" I was super confused because we were having sex for 24 hours every weekend. I was so attached already that I convinced myself it was okay and thought he was just scared of some sort of relationship escalator. Somehow we kept seeing each other. I wish it ended then. The cycle became more intense and rapid over the next 2 years together. We would go on a romantic vacation, have the sweetest time, and then days later he would tell me he's not actually sure he likes me that much and can't see a future with me. In the last year of our relationship these moments escalated to nitpicking me. He would seem so connected and in love with me, then turn around and have a conversation with me where he spent hours insulting my personality and presentation. He said my voice was annoying, my laugh is annoying, I'm not funny enough for him (but he's 'so goofy he could be a stand up comedian', ugh). Once he said he couldn't introduce me to his mom because I have hair on my upper lip. He'd say we're incompatible because he's more spiritually connected then me. I became so confused and felt I had to defend myself. I felt like I could never be good enough. The criticism was contradictory- sometimes he would tell me I'm too loud, sometimes that I'm too shy. Unlike some other posts in this sub, the criticism was delivered in this subtle tone. He didn't yell or call me names. I convinced myself that it was \"communication.\" But I would never nitpick him like that- I loved him. This whole time, he was best friends with the ex from right before me. He idealized her, said they wanted to be together but couldn't because he wants children and she didn't. They spent hours together every week, texted every day. When I expressed that it's fine they're friends, but I needed extra care and communication around their relationship to feel secure, he said \"You don't know what you're talking about,\" and \"Sorry I didn't do the traditional thing.\" He said I had a problem with jealousy. Once, he brought her to his mom's birthday party without telling me. This party was months in the works and he never once mentioned he was taking his ex. I found out the next day and had a meltdown. His response was \"Well my mom invited her, what was I supposed to do, tell her she couldn't come?\" He used the fact that we're both queer and our relationship was not monogamous to downplay my needs. It drives me crazy because a nontraditional relationship requires MORE communication, but he treated my needs as too much or controlling. Exactly a year ago, the worst moment in the cycle happened. We had broken up once, he told me he missed me so much. He told me everything I'd been wanting to hear for 2.5 years- that he could see a future with me, he wanted to make me the most important person in his life, he could see us having a family together. This lasted 2 weeks. On a Monday, he told me he was thinking about which graduate program to go to (social work, oh god) based on our timeline for having a family together. 3 days later on a Thursday, he told me he actually has no idea what he wants, that he thinks I'm not his person because maybe he needs to be with another POC (he's Puerto Rican, I'm white) or someone who's spiritual like him. He left me. We had some moments of re-entanglement in the months that followed. Another romantic trip followed by saying I'm not his person 2 days later. When we finally broke up in the fall, I was heartbroken. In the time since then, I've told more people about what happened between us and realized that his treatment of me was shitty and not okay. I became consumed by wanting acknowledgment and apology from him. I felt I couldn't help myself from texting him and calling him. He blocked me on everything and told our mutual friends I'm being invasive. He thinks I'm making it up and says 'We're just two people with two different perspectives.' I talked to another one of his exes from a decade ago who said their relationship was the worst she's ever been in. He insulted her intelligence, refused to acknowledge they were actually in a relationship, made jokes at her expense in public. He told me he dated this woman for 6 months, but it turns out it was actually 2 years. I can't make sense of why the ex before me can be his best friend. Recently, I reached out to his church to tell them about my experience. I wanted validation. It seems like his pastors believe him though, and said I need to heal on my own and that I need to honor his wish to not correspond with me. I'm heartbroken that 2 women and a \"progressive and justice oriented\" institution don't seem to believe me. My therapist and a friend who's a therapist both brought up covert narcissism.",

But in the end, none of that mattered. My feelings didn't matter. I was made out to be the villain, even when I was the one hurting. And just to be clear: I was never the jealous type. I never tried to control her. I encouraged her to live her life, spend time with friends, do what made her happy. I never told her what to do or control her. This was, without a doubt, the most toxic, manipulative, and narcissistic person I've ever met. She twisted every situation to make herself the victim, constantly gaslit me, and made me question my own reality. No matter how much I gave or how patient I it was never enough because the truth is, it was never about love or partnership. It was always about control and hurting someone. To this day, I still don't know what I did to deserve the way she treated me. I never gave her a reason to think I was unfaithful, but that's what she called me. I was never verbally abusive or abusive. If anything i felt like the one going through it. the only time I ever laid a hand on her was at Disneyland, and I'll get to that later. That moment broke me. And yes, I still carry guilt for it. But I was not the monster she made me out to be. I. Swear to you guys that in telling the truth, if a guy or even girl is going through something similar, think about your situation. Put you first. There's a lot more, I wish I could say but I'm trying to keep this short as possible. I was young 20 or 21 when we started dating. We met through mutual friends, and not even two weeks in talking, she asked me to be her boyfriend. I told her I wasn't ready. I had just gotten out of a relationship. She turned away and cried, and even though I didn't want to jump in too fast, I didn't want to hurt her either so I stuck around and told her to be patient. That should have been the first red flag. 🚩 A month in asked her out, still felt too soon. But i liked her. So In the beginning, everything seemed great. She wrote me letters, gave me small gifts, even bought me a PS4 later on. She told me her parents didn't support her, that she had to \"fight\" just to spend time with me. That made me see her as someone misunderstood. It made me want to protect her. Finally i met her parents and they actually seem alright i even bonded with her dad he was the much cooler and understanding person. I started working with him, learned flooring and carpet cleaning. I had more fun with him than I did with her most days. But when he asked me, \"Are you planning to marry my daughter?\" it felt more like a warning than a question. Now I get why. She would tell me her family was against her, her cousins were fake, her parents didn't understand her and I believed her. I thought it was me and her against the world. But the truth is… the common problem wasn't everyone else. It was her. As time went on, she changed. She became controlling. Jealous over everything. If I was with friends, she'd blow up my phone. If was with my girl cousins, she'd accuse me being shady. If I didn't respond fast enough, it became an argument. She once even replied to a guy on Twitter that she didn't have a boyfriend just to spite me. I hadn't even done anything to cause that. I confronted the guy, and she told him she had \"no idea who I was.\" We broke up briefly after that, but she begged me to come back. Her mom even called me in tears, asking me to forgive her. So I gave her another chance. On my birthday, she bailed on the celebration because of a miscommunication I thought she was starting another fight through text, and I responded harshly. I messed up. I can admit that. But she never let it go. For the rest of our relationship, every single argument brought it back up. It never ended. She blocked doors when I tried to leave during arguments. I wanted space to cool down, it would probably help both of us. She yelled and told me I wasn't a real man for walking away. She'd compare me to her exes, and even to her brothers, saying they treated their girlfriends better than I treated her. It got into my head and it started to feel like I was the problem. She went through my phone constantly. I didn't even care most of the time, but the one time I said no because I was tired of it, she blew up. Accused me of cheating. Told her mom, and of course, her mom believed her. Every little disagreement her parents got involved. It was like her mom was coaching her. I couldn't win. She later decided she wanted to stop having sex. Said she was waiting until marriage after we already had. I respected her body and her decision, but when I tried to express how it made me feel, she shut me down, got angry. My feelings didn't matter. I was so loyal, I even bought a pocket pussy just so i can give myself pleasure. That's how far I went to stay faithful. I paid for everything dates, gifts, her birthday. I didn't mind, but she never seemed to appreciate it. And when I couldn't afford her Disneyland ticket, she used that against me. The reason I bring this \"paying\" stuff because when it was my birthday you know what she got me? A basket of snack and a candle:/ don't get me wrong i loved it but common if i go out all on you i expect the same. I did try to tell her how i felt, she got so upset and call me \"ungrateful\". She told she was broke and had no money and i understand because that was me as well, but then i found out she bought her brother shoes:/ am i crazy for feeling some type of way? That night at Disneyland was the worst moment of my life. She got angry in a gift shop because I told her to not spend money on expensive pins. She stormed off. Called me, crying, saying I never chase after her. Then her mom called me, telling me of stop making her daughter cry. It never mattered what really happened she was always right in their eyes. Later, after drinks at the Star Wars bar, we got into another argument. In the car, she spit on me. Twice. Then she hit me. And I snapped. I hit her back once. Her nose started bleeding. I cried. I was ashamed. That's not who I am. But after months of emotional abuse I broke. I truly believe she wanted me to snap. She needed a reason to finally label me the abuser. And after that, mutual friends stopped talking to me. She had her story. And people believed it. We stayed together a little longer, but everything was different. She started acting like she couldn't stand being around me. I saw the breakup coming. During all this, I relapsed. Pills oxys, hydros, perks 10 pills a day. I overdosed. Ended up in detox. Rehab. I didn't tell her right away. Not because I didn't care, but because I didn't feel safe telling her anything anymore. Everything I shared was used against me. When I finally told her, she didn't care. I could hear it in her voice. She broke up with me while I was in rehab when I needed her most. This relationship broke me. I was always there for her when she had fights with her family, when she was sick, when she felt alone. I showed up. I dropped everything. But when I needed her… she vanished. I don't know what I did to deserve that kind of treatment. I know I wasn't perfect. I made mistakes. But I know I never lied. I never cheated. I never tried to control her. I was patient. I was loyal. I was present. She made me believe I was the bad one but now, looking back, I know I was the one trying.",

    "text": "I need advice, help, suggestions, or to be physically yanked out of this situation and prolly smack some sense into me while youre at it. My boyfriend and i met when i was 15 and he was 16. i am now 19 and hes 20. a little back story on us is he is the first guy i have ever been with. and he needs me because he has nobody but me no family or friends, im his only emergancy contact. !TW! relationship abuse! verbal and physical!!! please do not continue to read if you struggle to read these type of things!! at this point sit back relax and read cause this is a whole lot. its been close to 4 years now. we were not together that whole time it was on and off constantly. and the first two years we didnt see eachother like at all because of my living situation. but that entire 4 years we were on facetime 24/7 all the time even sleeping we were on facetime. we gone through alot with eachother literally trauma bonded. This year we have been physically around eachother the most the entire 4 years. thats when i quickly realized who this man really is.... It was about February or so he had gotten very upset with me for wearing leggings to work. ( i work in a hospital i cant wear jeans and a sweater and leggings are super cute together) we were at one of our usual spots we go to sitting in his car talking and listing to music when he brought up the leggings. what seemed like a simple conversation to me quickly turned to him on top of me holding me down in his passenger seat screaming at me. (within like 5 minutes) what he didnt realize was a woman witnessed this whole situation and was already on the phone with 911. he had found out that she called the cops and he freaked out and took off with me in the car. as we were leaving the spot we got pulled over. my dumbass didnt press charges i also found out he doesnt have a license and i drove his car to the other spot we go to. i continued to be with him after that. the next situation.... this was march ish this year... he had pressured me into giving him my virginity, in the car he was living in at the time. ( now i look back why did i do this) long story short i gave it to him. and ever since the first time i gave it to him he had always begged me for more which i gave in because he was the first guy to ever give me that attention. (btw the sex wasnt amazing like to this day i still fake it, i dont feel any pleasure from it or any special way and his dick has a curve so idk if thats the issue,. but i do have endometriosis so that could also be my issue.) but long story short a few months go by of arguing screaming at eachother and still fucking none stop everyday. well end of may beginning of june i found out bro gave me fucking chlamydia.... so i lost my virginity in a fucking KIA RIO by a guy who lives in that kia and got chlamydia the first time i ever have sex with a man, GREAAAATTT he told me the last person he slept with was an ex of his a year ago..., yah no way thats true. well long story short i stayed with him after that.. now the next thing that happened this year, was a sunday night me and him both had work in the morning but my dad had offered us money to pick him up from his house and bring him to the bar... at this time he promised me he had a ride back. at midnight i get a call saying i needed to pick up my dad and his friend from the bar cause they needed to go home. so me and my bf went to go pick them up. my bf is driving at this point. long story short we pick up my drunk dad and friend and head back top my dads house which is a 20 min drive. my dad sat in the backseat behind my bf and his friend sat in the backseat behind me. well my dads friend wouldnt stop grabbing me and m bf got mad and slammed on his breaks on the interstate he didnt fully stop it was kinda a warning jolt ig. well my dad freaked out and was threating to kill my bf while he was driving for hitting the breaks and so my bf pulled off into the farm and fleet parking lot where all 4 of us got out and fought eachother (in a sense) i had to pull my dad off my bf cause he was hurting him my dad turned around and punched me which ripped my nose ring out. we continue to fight my dad and bf are chasing eachother and i turn my focus to my dads friend who was drunk and saying some really mean things about us so i beat on him until i realized i had to go rip my dad off my bf again it went back n forth for awhile till randomly i dont remember how this happened but my bf hit my dad with his car in the parking lot, at that point i called the cops. my dad was taken to jail my bf was taken to the hospital and my dads friend was taken to jail on a warrant. i have no idea why or wtf that whole situation was but my bf wasnt hurt that bad by my dad okay he didnt need to hit him with a fucking car. next situation that happened was august or so this year, it was my birthday end of summer last boat ride my family was going to do and it was for my birthday. my brother had gotten me super drunk given thats the first time i ever got to drink with him it was fun, i was ignoring my bf because he was being rude and saying i was a whore for wearing a swimsuit around my family. so i let my phone die and continued to party. well instead of going back to my sisters house where i lived at the time i went back to my mothers which was an hour away. well because my phone died he went crazy and showed up at my sisters house and waited outside at like 2 in the morning well his car is all black and has was on the side of the road in the front of their house and it was like 2 so the neighbors got nervous and called the cops which was a very valid reason my sister lives in the middle of nowhere and the neighbors know what our cars look like. well long story short he got arrested which still to this day he blames on me. whatever he can stay mad he was being rude and it was the weekend before my birthday. then comes the last week in august the actual date of my birthday i had to work for part of that day so i was already not having it, well at work i found out he was texting this chick at 3 am asking what shes up to for the day wanting to be with her. so given the anger of it being my birthday i egged his truck at his job and went and got a tattoo. (therapy duh lol) fast forward to beginning of october i finally found my own place i moved in adopted a kitten this was one of the weeks that we were broken up i was happy ish for that week. well now begging of november he wanted to stay a few nights and i was okay with that cause it was just a few days. HE NEVER FUCKING LEFT!! I WANT SOME SPACE!!! its been 4 weeks now i have asked for him to leave and go back to his apartment and he wont he calles my place his fucking place and doesnt pay anything. well last weekend i asked him to get out he was being rude i needed space to myself and my cat and he threw a fit like i kid you not looked just like a 3 year old having a tantrum he then flipped from a tantrum to anger and started getting in my face and yelling at me so i smacked him cause he was cornering me and that was my response to that, he then jumped on top of me and hit me and bunched me and hurt me so bad several of my acrylic nails came off my fingers were bleeding and i was over it i finally told him you dont leave im calling the cops, took an hour he finally left. well stupid me next morning i told him to come back and chill out while i was at my mothers ( which is a block away from my house) he got there was there for like 20 minutes then i got there. he was acting super sus but i didnt think anything of it till i sat on my fucking bed and it was wet so i asked him why it was wet he seemed nervous and said idk idk idk and swore on his bio mom he had no idea well i told him hes taking all the bed stuff to the laundry mat and is washing them he got up and left to do just that. while he was gone i dug through his laundry and found wet pants of his and found out HE PISSED HIMSELF ON MY FUCKING BED. he came back and i was like are you going to tell me the truth and he was like i think the cat did it and i said no im not stupid tell me and he then swore on his bio mom that he spilled milk on the bed too that was three days ago he will not admitt to it at all. that gave me the biggest ick ever and i cant look at him the same rn like im not even attracted to him rn. well he keeps begging me and pressuing me to sleep with him his begging got so bad that i gave in just so dude can nut and stfu. im so over it. but i feel like hes the only person thats going to ever understand me and given that he took my v card i have this weird attachment to him. i genuinely dont know what to do anymore. i need help advice or something cause idk if its just me but all of this just seems so wrong. i have been told he has done some very weird creepy thing other women that he has been around in the past which makes me so worried. help!!!! there is so much more to this story so if you want me to go into detail of something lmk and i can. Update: I have a strong emotional attachment to this man. i have confided in him for every small inconvenience in my life. if hes gone out of my life i have no one i can run and rant to about ever possible thing that i go through and need to vent about. i live alone with my cat its nice to be alone some nights but sometimes its nice to know someone is there yk. Last night i kicked him out made him grab what he could and to go back to his place. it was nice having him gone. but i woke up this morning and.. he wasnt there no good morning nothing. i hated it. i use to call him on my ride to work every morning. he wouldnt pick up the phone. hes been texting back a little bit but not much at all. i want him back but i know i shouldn't do it. ik i need to move on ik i will be happier but ik the pain of missing him is gonna hurt more than anything. if anything the pain of missing him is going to do what it did to me for the past 4 years.... its going to bring me right back to him. literally drags me back to him. can someone tell me why? can you please tell me why it feels like i need him. why cant i get over him? i have struggled with this weird mind thing for my whole life. i never let people touch me i havent hugged anyone besides my bf in like 2 years. i dont do physical touch i dont meet new people, i dont talk to people in person. its all to scary to me but with him i felt a sense of being okay. i felt a sense of trust no matter how badly he hurt me it felt like it was okay. im scared if i leave him and leave him for good ill never find that sense of okayness to let another man be near me know me or touch me again. to start all over is terrifying. i know he has good intentions his anger just takes over and i can see it. i literally watch it happen. ive experienced it with my mother so ik what im looking at. and maybe im making up more excuses for him. but my heart is telling me to stay my brain is telling me to go. he lost his mother when he was 7, we watched her OD right infront of him. his father disappeared long before he was born. he was thrown around foster and group homes till the age of 10. he then was adopted by his aunt and her husband at the time. when i met him at 15 his aunt and husband went through an awful divorce she left my bf with her ex husband and took his brother with her and moved states away. the husband wanted nothing to do with him except the check he got every month for having him there. he would kick him out till the last weekend in the month till he got his check and then kicked him out again it was a never ending process till he turned 18. my bf has been in and out of legal trouble and just kept getting into trouble. i feel bad for him cause the way his cards of life were dealt to him seems so unfair. but i think about the fact that i was also dealt unfair cards and i maintain a good attitude on life and i treat people with respect. i will say i have been in therapy since i was 7yrs old i have gone every two weeks of my life and prolly will never stop going. i was put through some of the worst traumatic events in life more than once. one of the many many things ive been through is being hurt by grown men in many different ways, i grew to have a quick defense in my head when my brain feels that i might possibly be in an unsafe situation with a man i will immediately start fighting to defend myself. so i will admit i did hit him once or twice but only because he was in my face or cornering me. which is no excuse for me to put my hands on anyone but i wont deny what i did either. i just want to feel okay and happy yk.",

I'm falling apart and I hate myself for trusting that I could have a second chance with my boyfriend (18 M) and me (17 M) He is an absolute control freak. Here's a handful of what he does.- Every single app i have is monitored by him. Especially social media, he has my password to everything and i mean EVERYTHING. - I have to show him my screen time and battery tab (Iphone) upon waking up and going to sleep every morning and every night. -No friends. None. If I talk to anyone but him or my family it's considered cheating. I need help leaving this relationship. You might think 'Just block him, simple.' but it's not.. Not when you have a relationship with him the way I have. He is kind and loves me, truly. But his controlling nature is ruining us. He's booked tickets over to the UK from France in the summer and I don't want to hurt him by telling him he can't come over. I am terrified and I really need advice, i'm sorry.",

    "text": "hi, i'm today F17, but when this happened i was 15/16, i had a relationship with someone who suffered abuse when he was little, he went to therapy all these years and he said he solved it, we had intercourse because we wanted to, he asked for something else which i didn't really like but ended saying yes, happened two times, the third time he almost hurt me and i asked to stop, he victimized while i couldn't move much, he also asked me for oral sex, i didn't really like it but i did it for him, i tried to say no bc i didn't like it, he still asked for it, few times he said sorry when i was doing it because he knew, i had an awful situation doing this where he forced me to something i didn't like and almost made me puke. time passed by and every thursday (we go to the same school, different years, he is also 17 today, was 15-16 in that time too) i would walk home and he would make me company, asked if he could pass by my home to get water or pee, my parents were never there on thursday, he would always start kissing me or touching me, leading into sex, i guess there were times i liked it, and many times i didn't, i can't really remember how i feel about it, i only know that today it hurts me to have been in that situation, he would touch me in public and say sexual comments, and last times we were together i can fully say i didn't want to and said yes because he wanted to, i dissociated those times, he made me so uncomfortable that i broke up and then came back together after two months, i went to his home, because bad situations where i asked to please do not do this or that, he ended up doing them sometimes, when i went to his home and we had sex again i asked myself why was i there again, broke up and didn't think about abuse when i got many videos on tiktok about it, many times i didn't want to and he would always convince me with stupid stuff. i feel awful knowing i'm not dumb and i could have stopped it, my mom and psychologist say the problem was that i didn't say no, and why didn't i say no if i didn't like it? and it's a bad answer to say just bc he was my bf. yesterday the guy i like asked me to be his gf, i said yes but i think i need to talk to him again because i don't feel okay with this topic, i still didn't solve it, what's a good advice to get though it, or if this isn't abuse because i also got told this isn't abuse and i wanted it, or let it happened a lot of times so it doesn't count, i'm not sure what to ask for here, just someone who can help me",

    "text": "I was 22 when we started dating. She was 28. I had no real relationship experience—still a virgin, autistic, and just wanted love. I didn't know what a healthy relationship looked like. Early on, she refused to get a job or drive, even though her parents paid for her car and insurance. Everything—money, transportation, emotional labor—fell on me. I didn't recognize it then, but the imbalance started immediately. At first, things felt exciting. We even watched porn together. But later, when I watched it alone, she called it cheating. She got angry if I talked to lady friends. Once, she asked my breast size preference—I said \"big,\" and she lashed out. I never knew what would set her off. I broke up with her after a year, but went back a month later. Less than a year after that, we were engaged. I cut off a lesbian friend I bonded with over music because she demanded it. Arguments were constant, but I always gave in. \"I'm sorry\" became a daily phrase just to keep the peace. Meanwhile, I was expected to be the breadwinner—even while broke and in school. She refused to contribute in any way. In 2015, I fell for a younger woman from Denmark. I confessed to her in 2017, and though she turned me down, we stayed friends. I broke up with my fiancée again but went back (again). She told me to block the Danish woman—so I did. When I finally started college in 2018, things got worse. She grilled me constantly about who I talked to, convinced I'd leave her for someone younger. I kept reassuring her, but I was suffocating. By 2019, I was emotionally cheating with multiple women. I was drinking heavily, ashamed of myself, and suicidal. I was desperate for the emotional connection I couldn't get from her. Then COVID hit in 2020. The forced distance gave me peace. In 2021, a friend I met in college told me, \"You deserve better.\" That gave me the courage to finally leave—for good. Now, four years later, that friend is my fiancée. I'm in a loving, stable, and healthy relationship. I finally know what real love feels like.I'm sharing this because emotional abuse against men is real, and too often ignored. It took me years to realize what I was living through. If this feels familiar—you're not alone. You deserve better. You deserve peace.",

    "text": "I just joined this sub because I have had a lot of thoughts lately about my ex that I can't shake off. This is kinda a rant and also me looking to see what others view in this situation. TW: sexual, emotional, and physical abuse This is a lot for me to explain, so I will just start from the beginning. I'm sorry if this is all over the place. I would also like to say that I know I have had my moments of flaws and am not perfect myself, but I feel some scars cut deeper than others. How we met: When I was in high school, I had a friend I will call M. M was always sweet, always there for me through boy troubles, nightmares, family issues, etc. I never found him very attractive, but he was a wonderful friend. I never found any guys that matched up to his support, so I started to like M. We started to date and I even told my parents how much I trusted him after being friends for so long. His ex: Before we started dating, he had a girlfriend. He had told me about his ex, made her seem crazy. He would say she would go to parties and not answer her phone and he thinks she may have cheated. One day, he sent a pic to me and all his friends of him and her in the mirror with his handprint on her butt. He told me they had sex. Then when we started dating and started to get serious, I told him I would like for him to get tested and I can as well even though I was a virgin. He told me they never actually had sex and I believed him because I trusted him. (I still to this day don't know the truth). He told me the reason they broke up is because she was doing something with her family and he kept asking her to answer her phone and she eventually could not take it anymore and broke up with him. Our overall relationship: Everything was great to begin with. He took me on dates, paid for everything, made sure he got consent for everything, etc. Once we started having sex, everything changed. If I didn't answer the phone soon enough he would get upset. If I didn't feel like calling he would get upset. Sometimes he just wanted to call and do nothing to \"be in my presence\" but would get upset if I said no. What makes me question the relationship: I remember once I was in the car with him, and he did something that made me say I felt like he was being controlling. He then said \"Oh I'm controlling?\" and as I started to get out of the car he locked the door and wouldn't let me out until I explained myself. When we had sex regularly, he was first really great about after care and making sure we were both satisfied. Sooner or later he would start to disregard my feelings. We would have sex, he would clean himself, throw a paper towel at me, then go play video games. When I started to notice this, I would of course get upset and he knew. Then he would go play video games and go eat and when everyone asked where I was he would just say I wasn't feeling well. Sometimes I would hurt afterwards and he would get annoyed by me complaining. There was once that we did it and then were in a rush but I was hurting in the car so I asked for some ice from sonic. He was irritated that we had to stop but I bugged him enough to get him to so it. I would like to make it clear that he never held me down or physically forced me to have sex, but he would coerce me. We were in a pretty serious relationship and would talk about marriage and kids but that was when we were older. Still far ways to go because we were still only in high school. Eventually I told him I would like to stop having sex for a while because I felt used. He was ok with it at first but then started saying things like \"If you loved me you would have sex with me\" or \"Do you not want to have kids in the future?\" until I said yes. Then, like mentioned, would disregard me afterwards to play video games or eat. There was also things I was into during sex like him grabbing my boobs, choking me, and slapping me, and pulling my hair, that I obviously only liked in the bedroom. He would do that stuff outside of the bedroom even though I asked him to stop and when I reminded him he would just say \"Sorry I forgot\" and laugh. It would hurt, but it never left a mark, so I thought it was fine. I also used to enjoy being \"dominated\" and like he \"owned\" me in the bedroom until all of that started. At the beginning of the relationship, we had both greed that if anything happened during sex we didn't like, we would say it right there and not wait until we were finished. Well we were sexting one day, and he said something like \"i own you\" and again, I liked it before, but for some reason something switched in me and I didn't like it anymore and told him that. Then he got mad and said I should have waited until he had finished. One time when I brought it up to him, he started taking everything in his room related to our relationship and throwing it at me saying \"I guess we should break up\" and \"here is all your stuff\". It didn't physically hurt me, but like he still threw stuff at me?? I told him if you ever do that again I'm leaving. Well sure enough, he did, and I tried to stick to my word and walk out. He blocked the door, and when I got past him he grabbed my arm begging me not to leave. It hurt so came back to him so he would let go. It left a slight mark on my arm for a few seconds then went away, but he made me think he felt awful for it and convinced me to stay. Eventually, we both were at the same college. I lived in the dorms while he lived in an apartment. A guy, I will call O, in one of my classes asked if anyone had a different class he needed help in and I said I did. I, being in the situation I was in, thought a bunch of other people would also be in the class and we could all get together. It turned out just being O and I. I told M, and he was surprisingly ok with us meeting together as long as I kept updating M. I started realizing that as acquaintances, O spoke to me and treated me so much better than M did as my own boyfriend. M started asking for sex again, and when I said no, he started asking if it was because I was getting with O. I will admit, I started to catch feelings for O, but I NEVER cheated or even flirted for that matter while I was still with M. But as M grew more insecure and O showed me kindness, I was wanting to break up with M. Eventually I did, and because I didn't know what he would say if I said it was because I felt mistreated, I just said I felt like we were better as friends. This ended up being fine, but then he found out later that when I told people he sexual assaulted me that I was crazy and acting like he raped me which did not happen. I don't know what happened but whatever happened did not feel okay. After I broke up with him, O and I started dating not too long after. I am very aware how it all looks. I know it looks like I cheated. I know it looks like O was a rebound. But I did not cheat and O and I have been in a very happy relationship for nearly 3 years and two beautiful (fur)babies. Honorable mention: When I broke up with him he asked if he could eat me out one last time after all of that. Anyways, I just wanted to rant and kinda gather all the things somewhere to remind myself I'm not crazy. I feel like I can't say I was raped, because it was never physically forced, and there were some times where I dud genuinely want to have sex and consented. I also feel like I can't say I was physically abused or hurt by him because most of it I consented to at one point or another and nothing ever bruised me or anything. I know at the least this is emotional abuse, but part of me wonders if it was worse than that or not. Now M has a girlfriend, he gets to go off and play the victim and convince everyone I cheated on him and I get to be the crazy ex who up and left for another guy. I'm sorry this is so long and all over the place. Thank you if you read this far and I hope everyone who is in this sub is okay. All of you are strong and deserve the best. And M, if you read this and think this is about you, it is. You may have silenced me to our friends but you still suck!",

    "text": "I hate that I'm always the one putting in effort. He barely talks to me other than the standard \"how's your day\" and \"how did you sleep?\". I told him recently I don't enjoy calling because all he does is sit there and game or just goes to bed. I sent 4 paragraphs explaining how I treat FaceTime as a form of quality time to talk, and he responded with \"okay I see\". I never get flowers, he never plans dates, nothing romantic or elaborate despite me explaining over and over this is something I like. I feel so exhausted and so unsatisfied. Like I'm chasing a ghost. It's so exhausting to see everyone get such amazing treatment from their boyfriend but I'm begging mine to talk with me bedding small talk. He never takes an interest in anything I want to do unless I beg him to. He doesn't even feel like a friend, he never shared anything about his life with me. I'm so tired of crying, and I don't even know why I'm with him or why I allow myself to put up with this. I keep trying to make excuses for him, but i genuinely think that this is an awful relationship. I'm so miserable. I try to talk to him about it but then he gets defensive and says that everything is my fault. Everything is my fault, with him he can't take accountability. I don't even know why I'm still here bruh. I just have no one to talk to about this, and needed to get it off my chest.anyways",

    "text": "I think I'm in an abusive relationship again and I don't know what to do. Little bit of a back story: I (25F) have a 6yo son with my ex. He was very verbally and physically abusive and so was his family. His mom strangled me previously. His mom used to call herself mommy to our son and overstepped so many boundaries, I had been pushed, screamed at, told I wasn't a good mother and they would take my son away and I'd never see him again. We finally split up after 6 years and I gained the courage after he threatened to kill my dog and take our son away from me to the point I'd never see him again. I moved into my parents with our son and shortly after met my now fiancé (32M). We've been together for a year and four months now. Obviously I was in a vulnerable state, especially considering following that, on the day I was supposed to meet my fiance initially, I totaled my car on the way to work. So here I was, freshly out of an abusive relationship, no car; out of work due to no car, and single momming it up as I had a protection order against my sons father for a hot minute. My fiance knew all of this and knew I wasn't fully ready, but was willing to wait and help me through everything. A few months in, we were arguing about differences in parenting ways so I took a pregnancy test. It was positive. He got me pregnant two weeks in. He had told me he was 95% sure he was infertile as he had been careless previously and tried to have a baby for 8 years with his ex. These should have been my first red flags tbh. He lived in another state 2 hours away and I lived with my parents. I would drive down to see him every weekend after drop off with my son because he wasn't allowed to spend the night with my parents. It was fine, until there was one night I didn't get there until after him because I stopped to hang out w a friend and he got upset because I should've been there before he got home from work. I originally thought he was just being protective and sweet due to me being pregnant, it's a long drive, and it was late at night. Now I'm not so sure. He shortly after lost his apartment, I still went down to see him, whether that meant staying in a hotel or a tent. I would buy his food all the time and would pay his bills for him when I had it. There were a few times his ex's would pop up and he said they were his friends but I told him that made me uncomfortable so he said he stopped talking to them, then they would have his new number or call him or hed slip and tell me oh they said/are doing x,y,z. That isn't even where the real issues started. The real issues have started now that we have moved in a few months ago. When he moved in, we said we would split bills 50/50. That has not been the case… he was short on rent the first month by 250$ due to him being sick the week prior to rent being due. The second month, he lost his job because he woke up one morning and his car wouldn't start. Instead of trying to jump it, he just called out and went back to bed. The job called him later that day and told him not to return. He was 300$ short on his rent. He blames me for losing his job because I asked him if he would watch our baby as I was on thin ice with my job because before he moved in, I was constantly out of work due to either the baby getting sick or my son getting sick. I also made the mistake of telling him I would do the inside house work if he did the outside and the trash. He does outside work once or twice a month, and I help with the trash on the weekends. We have fought endlessly about helping me inside when I told him about how I was getting overwhelmed between both kids and the house chores and working as he was home more than me. He will tell me that he did something when I know for a fact that I did. There was one night he was making dinner and I stole some of the cooked veggies or meat or something after smoking 🍃and he yelled at me because \"I need to lay off\". He says he meant the 🍃 but I genuinely don't think he did. Because he has literally posted things like \"real men don't mind bigger girls\" and even told me that his coworkers told the girl who worked w him and was interested in him, she didn't have a chance because he liked \"bigger girls\". Now whenever we get into an argument he is threatening to take our daughter away and not return. A couple weeks ago, the first time he said it, I took his keys off the ring because I was like uh no and he said he was going to find me and smash my windows on my car. He has said it twice more now and I just feel defeated. The other day I came home and placed some groceries on the table and he yelled at me because I put them where he apparently was sitting. He has never put his hands on me but I know that's not what makes it abusive. I'm just scared to admit I'm in another abusive relationship. He says I compare him to my ex and it's not okay but he's literally doing some of the same behaviors. Like there was one day I asked him what he was doing cause he was just standing in the middle of the living room on his phone and he literally threw his phone at the ground hard. He tells me I must've cheating since I'm always on my phone and whenever we argue all I do is go straight to my phone but I just don't know what to do. There's days where we are great and he'll even go out of his way to do things for me like get flowers or coffee and I just don't know what to do. I don't want to have two kids with separated parents I never wanted this. He told me that he would never take her away from me and I'm a good mom. Any advice would be helpful because I'm just so defeated at this point and feel even more like a failure because why didn't I stop this… why didn't I run… am I just over reacting and over thinking and spiraling??",

During the entire process of my enlistment my boyfriend seemed super duper on board with the whole idea of me going as he knows this has been my plan since i was 15. Randomly the other day he i guess went down the rabbit hole of the sexual assault rates for women in the military and basically confronted me about it telling me that he \"didn't understand why i was choosing such a dangerous path\" and basically told me that it was like i wasn't valuing my life and safety by going. I understand that there are risks being a female in the military as there are risks being a girl anywhere and i've had multiple female friends join and be fine. I gave him my reasons for joining again (i promised my grandpa on his death bed that i would go- that's not the only reason it's just a big one as i was raised mostly by him during childhood) and he basically gave me the condition that he would drop the subject and be fine with it (to an extent of not tweaking about my safety every 5 seconds) if i promised to not be friends or interact with guys in the navy unless it's like absolutely necessary. I then brought up scenarios where if it was like a female friends brother or something and he got agitated and stated freaking out in the car about how i was creating situations to break the promise to not befriend any guys. I am not one to cheat and he knows this, this entire situation is happening because he believes that all the men are going to hurt me while i'm in there and he's made the point prior that since i will be away he \"won't be there to protect me\" which i did not like because he was making it sound like i am fragile and cannot hold my own and need him to protect me at all times. I don't think it's fair to tell me i cannot befriend half the population solely off the guidance of \"safety\" (also for context ive always had a lot of male friends the friend group i met my boyfriend though is all dudes) i don't know how to approach this situation because it feels like he is being controlling about all of this but i know it's out of love and need for me to be safe i know myself and i know i will probably end up becoming friends with guys while im in there, i had originally been planning on just not telling him about any of them but then i realized if i did that it could come off as me \"trying to cheat\" or something or put strain on the relationship for lying about it. I don't know what to do about this can anyone help find a solution to this?",

    "text": "I'll try to explain this as best as I can. I'm extremely ADHD, and I struggle a lot with writing and words. I, [M18], my partner, [M18] five months younger than me, have been dating since December 2020. Of course it's an online relationship, which I'm extremely insecure about. Everything's been okay since 2020, leading up to October 2024, to now. It's extremely complicated between us, but it feels like it's gotten much worse this year. Every time we get into an argument, or when I try to vent out how I feel, and what needs to be changed if we wanna continue our relationship, he hits me with \"I'm autistic, schizophrenic, and depressed. My parents are also dying, I can't help it.\" He also mentions/threatens suicide every time. It feels like I'm just being manipulated. Everytime I mention or hang out with people he doesn't know, or friends from our friend group (7 other people), he gets really pissed. But then he runs off and hangs out with his friends or people from our friend group and acts like everything is fine. When we vc while playing a game together, he gets sexual with me, and most of the time he says stuff like \"I'm gonna touch you\", which I'm not super comfortable with due to past trauma. (He uses the 2025 word slang I guess.) Anytime I say \"no\", or \"I don't wanna\", he gets all mad and huffy, and barely talks to me for nearly three days. But then he goes on and gets all flirty and makes sexual comments and jokes with one of his friends who is 20, almost 21. I don't know them as well as he does, and they're in our friend group, but it makes me really upset and insecure. Even when I need to get off for the night, (which is usually at 10:30pm) he gets mad and snappy.. when I mention my favorite band, motorcycles, favorite show, movie, or something I'm hyperfixating over, he gets annoyed. I really don't know if I can continue this anymore, and I feel like it's about time to split up. Anybody have any good advice?",

    "text": "I don't even know where to start. . My relationship feels like a rollercoaster and I'm very exhausted. I know I'm not happy, I'm not fulfilled, my needs aren't met. I feel unheard and unloved. But here's the thing—my partner isn't \"toxic\" in the typical way. He never shouts at me and never belittles me. He's a calm and kind man. The problem is that he's avoidant. He struggles with giving me emotional safety, with emotional openness, with compliments, with physical touch in public. And the thing that hurts me so much is his living situation. He's not capable of having a clean flat... His apartment is like a hoarder's place (without actually hoarding, more like piling up things and never cleaning). It's filthy, has almost no furniture, and in 5 years of being together he's promised me probably over a hundred times that he'd clean it and get it together. He never did. Not even for his child from his ex, who stays with him two days and nights a week..that's how bad it is. In the beginning, he didn't even allow me in his flat. I remember crying in front of his door, feeling completely shut out. I'm anxiously attached, so it was torture for me. I lashed out. I screamed. I said horrible things because the psychological pain was so intense. He blamed me for being mean and loud, and for a long time I thought I was the toxic one..and to be fair when I explode I get pretty toxic :/ Whenever I broke down, he'd just disappear. Leave me crying, sometimes even hitting myself, while he went home to sleep. He was also always late by at least half an hour no matter how much it hurt me. The only thing that's changed in five years is that he's not late anymore. But still… no flowers, no surprises, no making me feel desired, loved, or appreciated. He's borrowed things from me and hasn't returned them in years! I haven't been in his flat for over 2 years now. I just accepted it somehow.. For a long time he used to be in my flat almost 6 days a week, showering here, using my electricity and heat without offering to contribute. But thanks to therapy, I've started putting boundaries in place. Now, he sometimes only stays one night a week because I just can't stand it anymore without getting into a bad mood. I can't push these thoughts away or accept it anymore. And thinking of breaking up is now more present then hoping for change. He also avoids meeting my friends because he's afraid I'll get jealous (I do struggle with jealousy, but I want to work on it and I want him to meet them..). I've also never met his friends though they live far away, it still adds to this feeling that our relationship lacks so much of what a normal relationship has. I've been in therapy for almost a year now, and it's helped me see that I don't have BPD (which I thought for a long time cause of my emotional outbursts...) I have attachment trauma (my dad was emotionally unavailable and neglectful). It feels like I'm trying to be loved now by another avoidant, unavailable man, but I'm losing… and it's making me feel like I'm going insane. And yet… I can't break up. It's so frustrating. I know we're hurting each other. Sometimes I still explode, though less often now because I feel more detached and hopeless. But when I do lose control, I feel so guilty and ashamed afterwards that I freeze for hours or days. I'm constantly stressed. It feels like there's this heavy weight on me all the time. Maybe I'm codependent. Maybe it's a trauma bond. I don't think either of us is a bad or toxic person on our own, but this relationship has become extremely toxic. I dream of normality and safety. I feel so lonely, with not enough people around me to support me. I also worry about him. How will he cope when I break up? Breakups are so hard for me they almost feel impossible.",

    "text": "for context, we've been together for 3 years (21M and 20M) and all of this had started at the very beginning of our relationship. Whenever i do something wrong or make a mistake, he usually tells me how he feels, i try to understand and acknowledge it, but it usually spirals into an argument where he yells and calls me demeaning shit. For example: \"you're so stupid\", \"i hope i die before i move in with you\", \"you'll never be able to do anything on your own\", \"i fucking hate you\", \"i hope you die\", \"you have zero emotional intelligence\", etc. he never feels bad about any of these things due to a lack of empathy, and I've only heard him apologize maybe 3 times. If i have to go to school or take an exam he almost always gets upset and angry and tells me i'm selfish and i abandon him, same thing if i am hanging out with my family or taking too long to make myself lunch. He has tried to suffocate me in the past and lightly slapped me, and one time we were staying up late into the night so we could have sex even though i didn't want to because he said \"if you don't…\" I guess what i'm confused about is that i also have bad behaviors, for example i get very overwhelmed and emotional when he shares something that bothers him about me because I'm scared he'll leave, this often flips the conversation on to me as he says and he's left to reassure me, and i feel absolutely awful about that, and it makes him feel like he's being vulnerable with me and I'm being selfish. The problem is that he also feels awful and really sad and alone, and i hate that he feels like that, that's why i think im the problem. This entire relationship he has told me to change and that I'm ruining the relationship and i keep hurting him, and i do, i hurt him everyday in various ways, we have these \"arguments\" nearly every single day to the point where im crying in bed all night trying to think of ways to be better. We are moving in together in a few weeks, and i don't think i've been helpful or supportive. When i asked how i can be supportive, he told me to \"use my brain\", he told me he's tired of explaining everything to me and that i need to figure it out. Our arguments usually begin with something like him booking the wrong type of suitcase to bring on a flight, him telling me i'm irresponsible for not letting him know, and the argument spiraling. He then tells me that he has to do everything on his own because i turn the conversation on myself (aka walk out when he begins yelling at me). I feel so awful and guilty because i want to be there for him and i want to help him, but everytime i do, he pushes me away and tells me i keep hurting him and he can't trust me. Any perspective on this would be really really appreciated, thank you.",

Also if it's worth mentioning, I lived like this for 2 years. I had no contact with anyone else outside our relationship except family for about a year. • Breaking up was his only solution to every argument. Our first actual argument lead to a breakup and it started with me playing badly in a game he was teaching me and I didn't like that. He then started saying like how he'll just limit himself around me but I didn't like that so I explained why that's unhealthy then he just suddenly wanted to breakup. I am a very communicative person. I stopped speaking up ever since. But somehow, he still found a way to make arguments every single day despite me trying to avoid it. • He'd always tell me stuff like (non verbatim), \"You know, I don't tell people about us because I don't want to ruin you but it's up to you if you don't want to do the same\". However, there was this time when he accused me of telling my friends about us (I really didn't) and he was really freaking out. He even said, \"No one would say that without knowing what kind of life you have right now,\" then he tried to breakup with me. This made me feel extreme guilt so I never dared to tell anyone anything. Not even after we broke up. It took me about a year before I was comfortable enough to talk about it. • When I checked into a hotel to do one of my projects at film school, I was on a video call with him and I was at a table and next to me are thick and heavy curtains that covered the entire wall. He freaked out and made me draw the curtains because he thinks I brought another man into the room. • He asked to take a picture of my period blood to make sure 'i'm not lying.' • He always thinks i'm cheating. I never cheated. He was never cheated on. I was his first girlfriend. • He freaked out when I was invited to one of my friends' singing gig at a local resto bar. He knew about that and while I was hanging out with my friends, he messaged me freaking out and crying. I had to lie my way out of there to comfort him. • It was always a problem when I hung out with my friends. Even if he never asked me to, I drifted away from them and stopped hanging out until I had to cut them all off because he once again tried to break up with me, blocked me on everything when I decided to have barbecue with my friends after not seeing them for months. I simply stopped going out unless it's important. • He once secretly recorded me when he left me in his room to shower while I was on my laptop beside his PC setup to make sure I'm not \"tampering\" his stuff. I unfortunately had to unlock his PC to authorize a game I wanted to play thru steam family but that literally only took seconds to do. It was caught on video so he used that against me. Got mad at me and called me a liar. • He was in the middle of a meltdown while on video call. I was fidgeting which apparently to him, sounded like sex (the pounding sound) and I had no idea it made that sound and it made him think that I was having sex with someone else and he got really mad at me for that. • During one of our heated arguments, he started being verbally aggressive so I blocked him. He then emailed me a goodbye message. I freaked out so much but then he proceeded to email me a selfie of him with a rope tied around his neck. There's actually a lot more but this is all I could remember.",

It was 2018, and we met on a (at that time) always free app/website. In hindsight (it's always 20/20,) there were many behaviors of his and conversations we had that should have made me run right then. Instead, I ignored those glaring red flags and ran right towards him. He is a classic narcissist; he love bombed me and charmed me so much at first, all while simultaneously chipping away at everything about me. By the time things starting to get out of control (mentally, verbally, and sexually abusive) he had made me feel like he was the only person who could love me, and thus I felt as if I had nowhere else to go. In May of 2021 we moved into a home that we had built for us, and in October of that year he proposed. For so long I had thought that's what I wanted/was the next logical step for us, but really it just gave him more confidence to control and abuse me. During the entirety of our relationship, I honestly thought that because we were together it gave him license to have sex with me, even if I didn't want to. I know that sounds ridiculous, but I realize now that he had brainwashed me into believing that and he was entitled to it. Only recently did I put two and two together during a therapy session, that I realized what he did for years, was in fact rape. He never respected my feelings or boundaries, and kept gaslighting and guilting me into \"just lay[ing] there and get it over with.\" Even now, over three years after we spilt (which is a whole different saga in and of itself) and haven't had sex, I still am experiencing flashbacks and physiological reactions to what he put me through. Most days I am able to function \"normally\" and not have anything trigger me. However, there are some days like today, where the PTSD is so bad that all I want to do is curl up in the fetal position and ignore everything for an extended period of time. I can't do that though- I have 2.5 year old twins that need me, one of whom has Autism Level 3 (yes he is their dad.) So for their sake, even though I'm being forced to co-parent with my abuser, I have to push through even my worst reactions so they have a mom that can care for them. I'm not good at many things, but I know without a doubt that I am a damn good mom. I love them more than anything and anyone in this world, no matter what I've gone through in the past. To be honest I'm not sure where I was going with this exactly, so if you read this far, I appreciate it. ❤️",

We have been married for almost two years now and our problems have really intensified since the discussion of having kids has come up. I feel our conversations never go anywhere and we are discussing about things in depth that I feel are unnecessary at this point (length of time we would hire a nanny for a week, exact division of labor, etc.) We have went to look at houses for sale because he insists our current house isn't big enough. He calls me crazy, says my emotions are from a potential iron deficiency, and twists things until I start to believe I'm the problem. He says I'm \"screaming\" when I'm just raising my voice to get answers. We keep going in circles because I never feel secure. Plans change constantly, especially about having children. We tried to conceive last month, then he told me he no longer wants kids because he doesn't trust me. I mainly believe this because I got upset for a few days after a negative pregnancy test. He sets weird \"conditions\" for intimacy, like telling me I have to go 24 hours without \"yelling\" before he'll have sex with me. My husband has hurt me physically before and has laughed about it afterwards or has said that it never happened. Lately, he keeps pointing out that he's \"been good\" because he hasn't been physically violent, as if that should make me feel safe. I found out he's been recording me, and I have recordings of him as well. He's now saying he wants a lawyer, but we went to therapy together for the first time tonight. I wish he would just give me a straightforward Yes or No answer as to whether he wants children with me. I realize what I am experiencing is abuse, but I feel my uncontrollable emotions and constant need for assurance are partially to blame. I recognize that I have an anxious attachment style while his is avoidant. Additionally, I have OCPD characteristics (I am not clinically diagnosed) that I have been trying my best to work on and minimize. I really fear having to start over at this age: I love my home and where I live, and we have a dog together. I still love him, but my gut is telling me that this is probably a trauma bond situation at this point. I would likely have to move closer to my parents if we were to separate and they are in a different state. I feel small. I feel confused. I feel like I'm becoming someone I don't recognize: reactive, anxious, always questioning myself. If anyone has been in this fog and found their way out, please tell me… how do you start to see clearly again?",

    "text": "Hi people, i have decided to write on here because i am pretty desperate. I just broke up with my abusive girlfriend because the love i felt for her faded every time she would treat me bad and i felt like i needed alone time(ofc i just told her i needed time because the love part would have resulted in a mess but at the moment i didn't even really realize how scared and unsafe i felt) It took a lot of energies out of me because i knew it wouldn't be easy to just leave, for me because i was attached and because she wouldn't have been happy, of course. So after thinking a lot and waiting i decided it just wasn't right, so i did it, i sourrounded myself with good people and broke up with her, and i was pretty reliefed because she seemed chill about it, ofc sad but she accepted my feelings in a decent way. Her being so understanding of me made me want to take like 10/15 days of time and then contacr her again and see if we wanted to get back toghether(yes it was wrong, i was really miserable and now that i realized most of the time she had me acting like a dog for her.) All of this seemed waaay to good to be true, In fact she wrote to me still for 5 days straight about how i was a horrible person and i was making her feel so bad and lonely and how i broke a promise(the classic promise 'i'll love you forever). That made me scared, it made me spiral especially because something similar happened so many times but i was so blinded that I hadn't realized. After all these insults she sent me a message wich meant basically: \"block me if you want because i'll text you how much I love you everyday because unlike you i keep my promises\". I did block her, because this felt so pushy and creepy no? Her abusive toxic mother wrote to me. My face went like this: 😦😦 Like are you for real? Ask your mother to text your ex when you break up??? What. Anyways, then she wrote to a close friend of mine on how much it was unfair, told them that leaving her wasn't just my choice, it was hers. And that she hated me blah blah blah that she didn't know why i blocked her and etc etc. I didn't get into details but i feel so bad for myself, i now realized with who i actually was and how bad it traumatized me. I think one on the worst things that actually happened wich i told no one because of shame is that one night we were at her house and getting ready to sleep, she wanted to have sex because we didn't have it in a long time but i truly wasn't in the mood but she kept touching kept kissing in a very rough way. I started to cry because i felt guilty of depriving her of thar because she wasn't in the mood, she completely went ballistic, she started bawling and trying to PULL HER HAIR out wich i tried to stop by grabbing her hands and she tried to hit me. I have beem phisically abused already by other people, whennshe tried to grab me i froze and looked at her with horror. That just made her more angry and she went on the couch and i went to the bathroom with my phone (to look at it yes, and unwind trying to calm down) She barged in, grabbed me and threw me on the couch because she wanted to talk. At the end we didn't because i got so scared i could't stop crying. I waa the one that had to make up and say sorry after that. But it never left my mind. I have severe trust issues now, and i feel like i'll never be able to love again. But since i think i'm a good person i'll commit to a serius therapy path to i'll heal so that the next person i'll date will never have to go through what I did. Can I hear some of your thoughts? Does anybody have any advice for me to feel better?",

    "text": "I fear that I have been in denial for a very long time about my relationship and I really need advice on whether or not I am experiencing some form of emotional abuse, manipulation, etc. I have been with my partner for about 2 years and I love him very much. However, we have been going through a rough patch that has lasted several months now. This is my first serious relationship so I don't know if this is normal relationship issues or if I need to let go. I want to start by saying that the first year of our relationship was essentially perfect. We had no arguments, no conflict and did everything together. At the time I had just moved away from my hometown and was really struggling to make friends but he was always there for me. He did so many random acts of kindness for me and helped me through some of my darkest times. However, at our one year mark we went long distance so we could both pursue different opportunities. This is when our problems first started. We are both very anxious so long distance was a huge struggle for us. During one of our really bad patches while long distance he even told me that he was going to kill himself and it was because of me. All the struggle was so hard on me I even stopped eating at one point and I missed out on certain experiences like going out with friends to prioritize him. I wish I could remember more details from this time, but to be honest I blocked a lot of it out. I do remember a lot of locking myself away in rooms and sobbing on the phone to him quite frequently and feeling the need to punish myself for the immense guilt I felt. However, I love him very much and we both wanted to keep fighting for our relationship. When we both returned home (about 6 months ago) it took a lot of work to rebuild. However, things improved a lot and we put it lots and lots of work to get through the built up problems. But it has never returned to normal, or how it was at the beginning. The last six months have been a constant up and down. Even though we don't really \"fight\" (never have been physical, don't yell at each other, etc.) we are both very sensitive and emotional. This has caused us to both get very worked up over small things, and it seems like \"talking things out\" is essentially half of our relationship or more at this point. Part of the issue, in my opinion, is that I have made a lot of new friends, which I did not have during the beginning of our relationship. That on top of the growing intensity of my studies and working a ton has made me a very busy person. I'm a lot more independent than I used to be and I think that makes him feel insecure. I try my best to still prioritize him, it seems like it is never enough. Whenever I have big plans with friends, such as a birthday party, some sort of crisis always seems to come up. For example, a few months ago was my friend's 21st. She was having this huge party and I had been excited for weeks to go. The night of things got really bad. He was texting me all these things about how he was harming himself and going to kill himself and that I should be there to help him and that I am prioritizing a party over him. I was texting him, calling him, even texting his mom and still I \"wasn't there for him\". Another issues is that when he calls me if he hears anyone in the background he will immediately hang up. This has led me to often leave social events to talk to him on the phone. The other day I was on the phone with him and my roommate came down the stairs and called my name. He immediately hung up and texted me calling me a liar claiming that I had been with my roommates the entire time. He also gets very anxious if I am out and am not giving constant updates or responding fast enough. Even if i'm just chilling at home, a response over 30 mins will cause him to start overthinking. He is an anxious person, and I am very understanding of that, but it has gotten to a point where I feel isolated from my friends because I always have to be checking my phone or running off to call him. I have become anxious to go to social events because I know that it will end up raising some sort of insecurity in our relationship. I understand needing reassurance , but the constant lack of trust when I have been nothing but loyal and respectful is honestly hurtful. Additionally, I feel like there is a constant flow of things that I am not doing right. Not giving enough compliments, not updating him enough, not telling him about my plans, not wanting sex as often, being forgetful, etc. I honestly just feel exhausted with all the expectations and sometimes I feel like the bar is impossibly high to ever reach. Not only that, but my shortcomings tend to become the blame for his anxieties and insecurities. He recently told me he felt ugly and had no confidence anymore due to my lack of compliments. I feel constant guilt and always end up profusely apologizing even when I didn't think I was doing anything wrong. Even after apologies, it never seems to make anything better. I will apologize, we cry, we talk it out, it gets better, just for it to be brought up again making me feel horrible all over again. Whenever we bring up our relationship concerns with each other, we both are so sensitive that it becomes very emotional very quickly. We always end up working it out through very long conversations, just for it to repeat again a couple days later. It's a constant loop I have been trying to break but I don't know how much I have left in me. He is someone I can really see myself with for the rest of my life, but I am emotionally drained and tired of not feeling good enough the way I am. I haven't been the perfect partner by any means and I have made some big mistakes too. I have really been working on myself though and I think I have made great progress, but it's hard to believe that when I constantly hear all the things i'm doing wrong. There is certain things I feel like he wants me to do that would change who I am and sacrifice my independence. He tells me he loves me for who I am, that I am good enough, and that he is proud of me for making friends and improving my mental health often, but many of his actions make me feel the exact opposite. He claims it is just because he needs a lot of reassurance but instead of asking for reassurance I get accused of being a liar, unfaithful or just made to feel like i'm doing something wrong. I honestly have never had a long term relationship and I don't know of this is a normal phase or if it is seriously unhealthy. Any advice on how to work things out or what to do would be very appreciated. I don't have a lot of people I can talk to about this so please any responses would mean the world to me.",

    "text": "hello im F18. I've been in my relationship for a year and a half now. I'm aware of our relationship dynamic, I'm aware of what's happening yet I can't leave at all. I feel so fucking lost without him but i feel so tired when I'm with him, everytime I just ask for him to act like he care, all he does is yell at me making me feel like shit wanting to be treated like a human being. He yells at me so much, punch things when he's extremely mad around me while I just cry. I know deep down if I keep staying it'll get so much worse because his aggressiveness towards me definitely grew throughout our relationship. He practically controls my life because i can't bear to lose him, he's my only friend since he made me cut off contact with my friends and he makes sure I don't talk to them by going through my phone, if i do its just more yelling about how i don't listen to him and that i stress him out all the time to the point he wants to die. I've tried to leave earlier in the relationship before but he's threatened me multiple times that he was gonna end his life and have self-harmed because of me. He cheated on me before too and left me for the other girl. for a while I was away from him, I was talking to my old friends again and I thought I was healing but I was struggling with alcoholism because of the breakup, though I was away from him so it was better at least till he contacted me and told me he regretted it so much, he told me he realized how much he loved me, how he cut my initials on his chest and how he would never do that for anyone else. I missed him so much and I gave in because I still loved him, he was so nice and i thought things were gonna work out between us but now it's so much worse. He always gets mad at me and I cry everyday, he blames me for not being over the cheating and how he's only acting like that because he's afraid of me doing what he did to me despite me telling him multiple times I would never do that cuz I love him so much. I'm sorry this was so long, i dont know what to do anymore. I dont have the strength to leave but I know i cant keep staying.",

    "text": "Throwaway account as my partner found out about my other account. I've been with my partner for over 6 years, and while the relationship had many ups, here are some things I've noticed, and I'm looking to seek more clarification as I feel like I'm going crazy. I also feel like maybe I'm the real wolf in this relationship, not him. He accuses me of love-bombing at the start of our relationship as a way to hook, line, and sinker him in. He told me absolutely no male friends and limited my ability to travel solo to once a year without him (I used to do this 3-4 times a year). But at the same time, he has hundreds of female FB friends. He has no problem saying whatever insult he wants about me, and when confronted, he says he's just joking, but when I do the same, I'm offending him, and he demands an apology. He uses my previous DV relationship and past ED trauma against me (i.e., why'd you use to chase after someone who hit you but don't show me any love?) He constantly talks about how he was the best, smartest kid in his graduating class, and how the only reason he didn't get into the university he wanted was because of racism and affirmative action against him. He told me on several occasions that he's the only one in my life who has ever loved me, and if I leave him, I'm going to regret it, and I'll never be able to find someone as good as him again. He constantly says he's an amazing boyfriend, and I should be lucky to be with him. He always brags about how much money he has/make but refuses to buy me or the household anything that costs more than $50-$100. We also split the bills 50:50 despite him making twice what I make. It's always HIS money that he spent half his life making, and no one else can touch it. He constantly says women only want men who have money, and they're only with men for their money. He makes fun of both my and other women's appearances (think around the lines of size, skin color/imperfections). When we argue (which is a lot), I always end up being the one to blame, regardless of who started it, such as 'It's because you don't to abc that xyz isn't happening.' He has called me emotionally abusive on several occasions. He threatened to sue me for abandoning my things him our shared home when I tried to leave once. I've spent years crying about my pain and needs in this relationship (which have mostly been ignored), but suddenly when his feelings are hurt for a few days, it becomes the main focus to make him feel better. He gets upset at me and shut down when I'm not in the mood to be intimate. He once took advantage of me sexually when I was sleeping, and when he was done, got up to shower and headed to work afterwards. In couples counseling, he'd constantly point fingers at something I did to cause us to argue, and when confronted with questions, he put up a wall. He says our therapist is out to get him and has quit after just 5 months because she was not on his side. He's also tried asking me to stop seeing her as he thinks she's trying to ruin our relationship. He goes out to dinner with his coworker one night, and when I would ask the next night, he turns me down, getting mad at me for being upset and saying I don't let him have any friends. When I cry during an argument, most of the time he tries to comfort me, but there were many other times when he'd just ignore me or begged me to stop because I was hurting him. If I made a comment about a random couple on a TV show, he'd internalize it and would think I'm talking about him, and he'd get upset. He regularly says 'I guess I'm just not good enough then' or 'I get it, you don't think I'm good enough' when I've never said those words in the 6 years we've been together. He'd make a string of empty promises to get me to do what he wants and then when asked about it later because those promises were never fulfilled, he'd tell me that he never said those things and that it's all in my head. It takes a lot for me to convince him to go out and do something with me, and most of the time when I do, he'd go \"I knew this was a bad idea. I should've listened to my gut\" when there's a long line or it rains or something happens that's an inconvenience. He has no problem asking me to open a joint bank account that only I put money in. He constantly asks whether I have enough money to pay my share of the rent when I've never not had enough. After 6 years and 0 infidelity, he still doesn't trust that I won't cheat on him. He's constantly paranoid that I'm meeting up with another guy when I go out without him or when I put on makeup. He once insisted that he tag along to a meetup group because he wanted to make sure I wouldn't hook up with another guy, not because he actually wanted to come. He has also said, 'What's with your obsession with making friends? Do you just want them so you can trash talk about me?' A lot of arguments ends with him saying 'Can you just apologize and say you love me?' Constantly brags about how he's the most successful person from his hometown and how he's close to becoming a millionaire but still takes what I buy without asking first or saying anything, despite me asking him on multiple occasions to not do that. Has said something to his mom about our relationship to where she responded with how what I'm doing to him is unfair and cruel. Doesn't think he even need therapy because there's nothing wrong with him, and our relationship/me is the one that needs fixing. When I do get to travel without him once a year, he'd accuse me of \"doing something I shouldn't be\" when I don't respond to him right away, even if there's a huge time zone difference, and he'd say I've abandoned him. Constantly calls the cops on our neighbors just for parking outside our property. Files a BBB complaint at least once a month. Expects to be able to buy a million dollar home for 500K because 'he deserves it and has earned it'. And when it doesn't happen, says the world hates him. Thinks his race (caucasian) is superior and every other race should be deported, regardless of citizenship. Calls all women with pink hair a 'disgusting' feminist. Calls himself the breadwinner, but we contribute 50:50. He once yelled at me and said 'What the hell's wrong with you?' during an argument. He'd constantly tower over me and balk louder in an argument, sometimes resorting to literally screaming, and would say 'I deserve respect.' Thinks he's entitled to my body whenever he wants because we're a couple. When I would tell him my feelings, he'd make it about his feelings instead. For example, if I say \"I feel hurt that you made a promise to me to do something and then gaslit me into thinking you never said it\", he'd respond with 'You made promises to me too that you didn't keep. I'm hurt too.' Asks me to choose an activity for date night but turns down all options given to him without giving one back. Then says I ruined the date night by not choosing anything. Gets angry and forces me to delete a picture that doesn't show his good side. God forbid if I take a picture of him with a stuffed animal, he'd yell at me until I deleted it as he thinks I'm going to post it online. When I'd bring up something he said or did months or weeks ago that hurt me, his response would be 'I don't remember saying or doing those things.'If something outside of me ticks him off, he'd come home with a fit and get angry towards me but then denies ever doing this later on. He only puts in an effort to do what I need from him when he thinks he's going to lose me. Otherwise, he'd just brush me off, push our problems under a rug, and pretend nothing ever happened. He loves telling me that I just love to fight. He'd comment on what I eat all the time, not in a 'That looks delicious' way, but in a way where he makes you feel bad for eating it or shows a look of disgust. Goes to Planet Fitness and gets upset that the gym isn't filled with wealthy men. I've been cutting his hair for free since COVID, and he gets upset when I don't want to do it when he asks. Complains that I wastes money but instead of buying what he needs, he takes it from me instead, such as a suitcase. Continues to do something intimately that makes me feel uncomfortable despite me telling him that I don't want to anymore. I'm probably missing some, but you get the idea. I also don't want to discount all the amazing times we had together. We lived through COVID together, moved to several states together, and he's overall a great partner when we don't have these issues. The good times just feel so good that it almost makes up for all the bad times. But the past year has been a living nightmare with all our problems amplified, and I almost need someone to tell me I'm not crazy and not throwing away a perfectly good relationship because I feel like I am. I feel like all our problems are because of me, that I need to fix it, and that I'm the one giving up and abandoning him if I walk away. He's told me that everyone in his life has abandoned him, and I'm the next one doing so, so that adds onto the guilt. Thanks for listening.",

    "text": "I've been in this relationship for almost two years and I feel trapped in a cycle I can't seem to break. I love him, but I'm starting to realise that love isn't the same as being cared for. He ignores me for hours, sometimes the whole day, and denies it even when I can see he's been active online. He doesn't seem happy for my achievements or acknowledge them at all, and he never shows interest in my interests or passions. When I vent or share something personal, he either ignores me or changes the topic back to himself. He rarely shows empathy, and often tells me my feelings \"aren't true.\" When he's upset with me, he's given me the silent treatment, refused to talk, and even deleted pictures he's sent me as a form of punishment. The worst moment for me was when I miscarried alone because he \"wasn't sure if he wanted me\" at the time. Whenever I try to talk about how I feel, it turns into him denying, deflecting, or flipping it back on me. If there's been conflict, he often ignores me, and later says I could have messaged him if I cared — even though he was the one who created the silence in the first place. I've told him before that we might as well break up, but I always get pulled back in when he's suddenly affectionate or attentive. Then the same pattern starts again — affection, neglect, conflict, denial and blame, punishment, me chasing him — on repeat. He ignored me for an entire day yesterday, and when I asked him about it, he denied it completely. I got frustrated and told him I wasn't going to see him this weekend because it feels like he only gives me attention when he's feeling horny. Instead of acknowledging that I was upset about being ignored, he immediately made it about how I had upset him. I just kept thinking — who isn't on their phone for eight hours? He didn't even message me when he got home. It left me feeling crazy for even bringing it up, and I instantly regretted saying anything because I know exactly what's going to come next. Now he's ignoring me. He does this as punishment. If I don't be the one to beg him to speak to me he won't talk to me. If I ask why he's ignoring me he'll tell me \"if you wanted to speak to me you could've\".I've tried to leave and break up so many times but I beg him to stay with me. He makes me feel like he doesn't care if I'm there or not. Why does he stay with me why won't he leave me and why can't I be strong enough to leave. We don't live together. It's not like I have to move out. I just need to stop being so obsessed with this loser of a man. I'm scared of leaving because I still love him, but I'm also scared of staying because nothing ever changes. I don't want to spend my life feeling unheard, unsupported, and doubting myself. Has anyone left a relationship like this and actually managed to stay away? How did you stop yourself from going back?",

    "text": "I am 19 and my long-term bf is 18 we have been together almost 4 years and currently live together while in college. To get to the point it's toxic it has gotten to the point where for months he would act like he was going to hit me. He verbally abuses me more frequently though. We would talk about how everything was getting worse and worse and how to fix it. Any slight disagreement or resistance can send him off the deep end. It's been draining. It led me to a mental health hospital for a couple of days after an attempt. Since before we started dating both of us have been in therapy. Somehow I think we have both become worse. I spent months begging him to change. It has taken such a toll on me that I feel I am going backwards in my healing. Everything I've worked to recover from my trauma of the past isn't the same. I became irritable and frustrated with my life. I'm embarrassed by my situation but I love him I can't leave. Recently I snapped one of the times he was acting like he would hit me. As he yelled and belittled me I slapped him. I'm not proud. I just felt if I didn't protect myself first he'd hurt me. And now it's gotten bad. Another time something happened and it got more physical. On both sides. Something he hadn't fully done before. Lots of pushing, throwing stuff at me, etc. It was scary. I was worried he would break my arm and our dog was terrified. I feel guilty for hitting him back. I attacked him. It wasn't pretty but I was so scared. I feel alone and I don't know if what I did was evil or valid. Yesterday he was trying to have sex and I wasn't in the mood. He felt self-conscious and ignored me right after being all over me. That gave me a panic attack reminding me of trauma. I couldn't hear very well and I felt like I was passing out and the whole time he was trying to go somewhere. I couldn't and kept telling him that. Not only did he push me around on the couch I was having my attack on. He pushed me off, dangled a TV over my head threatening me, and then dragged me to the bed and threatened himself many times. He ended up stabbing a hole in my bed. That time I didn't attack him because I was so scared. I don't know if it was better to let it happen scared or to attack. It seems like a lose-lose. If anyone has advice more so than just leaving him I'd like to hear it. Also just some thoughts and opinions. And sorry if this doesn't make sense it's late and I'm so tired.",

    "text": "Hi. This is a throwaway account because I honestly dont use Reddit and I dont want my abuser to track this back to me. I'm scared he will come after me so I will refrain from describing certain things. Backstory. I met a guy(M21) at a phone store when I(F19) was inquiring about phone prices. We got along, exchanged socials, and quickly got together. I spent a lot of time at his house and our honeymoon phase lasted not even two weeks. Quickly, he showed his true colors; physically expressing his anger when little things happened such as him spilling water, not having any marijuana left, or me asking to cuddle. First Instance of Abuse. I dont remember much about this night but I had asked to be intimate. He agreed. However, I have a history of rape and sexual abuse so I began to grow uncomfortable. I asked him, 'Please stop. Youre making me disassociate. Stop.' Yet, he just continued. I laid there, barely feeling inside of my own body and memories of my abuse replaying in my head. When he noticed me disassociating, I really don't remember what he said besides degrading me and, 'You wanted this.' I think I blocked it out like I did with a lot of my trauma. Main Event. He arrived home from work around 7:30 and had even bought me candy. He told me 'Just save some for me.' I did. He sat down in his chair at his desk and I held the candy out to him. I was met with anger and, 'Stop. Why do you always fucking do this to me? What is your problem? Just stop. Why do you always do this to me right when I sit down?' I had already been crying earlier that day so my emotions were high. I began to cry and told him, 'I was just trying to be nice and share the candy with you like you asked me to.' He then just told me I was fine and had no reason to cry. It was late after that and we were in the living room. I fell asleep but then woke up and decided to go sleep in his bed. I was extremely tired so I laid down on his side of the bed, the outside(he also has a habit of taking up the whole bed, leaving me pushed into the wall). When he was finally ready for bed, I was barely awake and it was two in the morning. I hadn't moved from the spot I laid down in. Immediately, I was told to move. I explained that I wanted to sleep on his side of the bed instead and he began to yell at me. 'Fucking move, just fucking move. Move over. Move!' I got up and told him I would just sleep on the couch. He told me he was just mad because he dropped his handheld console which made no sense to me as he was yelling at me to move and he had dropped the console onto the floor. I exited his bedroom and sat down on the couch, holding back my tears. He eventually walked out and threatened me, 'You're such a fucking baby. If you really want to see me angry, I'll show you angry.' I finally decided I would leave because I was scared he would hurt me. I entered the bedroom, grabbed my purse and my charger, and told him I was going to walk home. He begged me stay but I walked out of the bedroom and out of the house without a word. I made it about 20 to 50ft away from the house when he got on the porch and began yelling, 'Youre so small! You're acting like a baby! A middle schooler! Youre so small! Ending Thoughts. I know people have been through worse than me. I shouldnt be upset over just a threat but I was terrified. I didnt know if he would hurt me because I had seen him hit and throw objects before. I could have been next. However, it doesn't feel real. It doesn't feel like abuse. I know it is but so many people, men and women included, have been through so much more than a little threat and being lashed out at for offering their abuser candy. When I told him I was done with the relationship and stated my reasons why, he replied to my text saying that I was the real abuser because there was plenty of times he didn't want to have sex and did it anyway. He never told me no, communicated that, and I never asked him to do so, never forced myself on him, and never intimidated him into doing so because, as I have mentioned, I was already a victim of rape and sexual abuse. I feel like a horrible person and I'm having a hard time accepting that what he did was abuse. Was it even abuse though? Maybe I'm just overreacting but I'm struggling with how to feel.",

    "text": "I dated my ex for 4 years and after years of name calling, screaming, abandoning me, stone walling me, I finally left him. He used to scream at me out of no where and call me the most horrendous names like stupid, idiot, moron, ass hole, autistic, told me I had Asperger's, bitch, piece of shit, no one would ever want to be with me, I would be a terrible mother, and I'm in capable of complex conversations. Many times during his verbal tirades he would abandon me in the street at night, whether it's in our home town or a foreign country. He would constantly control and monitor how I interacted with people and would berate me for speaking wrongly. I'm currently in my 30s and had to move back into my parents to leave him and since I've left him all he's done is blame me for the way he's treated me. I feel so sad and shameful. I feel as if I'll never meet anyone again or have kids, I'm absolutely broken and my self esteem is shot. I don't know if I will ever be okay again, I am so damaged from this.",

    "text": "My boyfriend can make me really intimidated. He gets really angry and I often cry a little in front of him when he shouts. He slaps my ass in public and embarrasses me in front of his friends. He slapped my ass in front of his friends and said 'look at her jiggle'. I really felt embarrassed by that and wanted to cry about it. He always demands sex from me even if I don't want it. He won't take no for answer and wait until i feel ready. He said he wants kids one day, and although I do too, I dont think I could as im getting sick and tired of his bullshit. He always laughs and teases me because I'm quite emotional but I just don't want to feel belittled. I just wish I had someone who actually loves me for me and not just my freaking body, and makes remarks to his friends about how big my ass is or how curvy I am while I am sitting there having to take it all in.",

    "text": "I made a post maybe about a week ago talking about my situation with my boyfriend and how I want to break up with him. And things have kind of escalated from there. So yeah I'm fucked. Yeah, as the title says, I'm scared of my boyfriend. I have my reasons for this, one them being that the guy is just a stalker in general. Not just that, but he doesn't shower. He has my jacket, (I don't know how but he does???) He follows me EVERYWHERE, he's taller than me, and for reference, I'm about 5'0 or 5'1, and he's like 5'9 or 5'11. And he just scares me a whole lot. The guy could easily overpower me if he wanted too and that scares me the most. We don't have any real relationship going on. We mostly just wave at each other, and that's it. But for the past summer, I've done a lot of reflecting and stuff, and I realized then that this guy is a creep. I've said this in my last post, but I can't go to a different school for various reasons. One of them being I'm in the gifted program, taking advanced classes, and going to some expensive, preppy ass school for free. And I just can't throw an opportunity of a lifetime away. But im scared, and each day, it gets worse. He won't stop following me around, he'll stare and follow me to my classes, he'll wait for me outside the bathroom stalls, he's changed his schedule so he could be in the same classes with me, he's mesmerized my schedule so he'll know where I am. I'm scared, I'm really fucking scared. The one thing I'm grateful for is he doesn't know any of my socials or that I'm trans. I've only told one of my friends about this and they haven't been much help, but I'm still glad they stick with me. Thanks for reading this and if you see on the news about a trans boy found dead in a bathroom stall, then you know who it is.",
