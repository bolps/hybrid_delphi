### Latent Dimensions Analysis

Based on psychometric principles (coherence, non-overlap, theoretical grounding), the items were grouped into **seven distinct latent dimensions**. Each dimension reflects a unifying psychological construct, with items assigned based on shared behavioral patterns, underlying motives, and empirical distinctions in abuse typologies (e.g., Stark’s coercive control framework). Dimensions avoid overlap by separating *perpetrator behaviors* (e.g., control, threats), *victim experiences* (e.g., fear), and *positive relational indicators*.

#### **1. Coercive Control and Social Isolation**  
**Items**: 3, 6, 8, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 22, 25, 28, 31, 42, 44, 45  
**Label Rationale**: This dimension captures systematic domination through restriction of autonomy (e.g., dictating appearance, finances, social interactions) and isolation from support networks. Items reflect *monitoring* (e.g., tracking whereabouts, demanding purchase justifications), *jealousy-driven exclusion* (e.g., forbidding contact with friends), and *dependency enforcement* (e.g., blocking employment). These behaviors align with Stark’s theory of coercive control, where abusers erode independence to establish total authority.

#### **2. Emotional Abuse and Gaslighting**  
**Items**: 1, 2, 5, 10, 12, 30, 47  
**Label Rationale**: Focuses on psychological manipulation tactics that destabilize self-worth and reality perception. Includes *verbal degradation* (e.g., insults, public humiliation), *blame-shifting* (e.g., "it’s your fault I’m upset"), and *gaslighting* (e.g., denying aggression, inducing self-doubt). Item 1 (mood swings with aggression/apology cycles) exemplifies "trauma bonding," where intermittent reinforcement traps victims in confusion. Distinct from coercive control, this dimension targets internal identity rather than external autonomy.  

---

#### **3. Threats and Intimidation**  
**Items**: 7, 19, 32, 33, 37, 39, 48  
**Label Rationale**: Encompasses explicit or implied violence to induce terror without physical contact. Includes *sexual coercion threats* (e.g., sharing intimate images), *instrumental threats* (e.g., destroying property, revealing secrets), and *self-harm ultimatums*. Item 19 (non-consensual image sharing) represents enacted intimidation, while others signal premeditated fear tactics. This dimension is separate from physical violence (Dimension 4) as it relies on *anticipated harm* rather than direct bodily injury.  

---

#### **4. Physical and Sexual Violence**  
**Items**: 23, 40  
**Label Rationale**: Direct bodily violation, split into two subtypes due to distinct mechanisms:  
- **Physical Violence** (40): Unambiguous assault (e.g., choking, hitting).  
- **Sexual Coercion** (23): Boundary violations (e.g., pressuring sex after refusal).  
Though brief, these items form a cohesive dimension reflecting *tangible harm*—critical in abuse assessment as physical/sexual violence often escalates lethality. Separated from threats (Dimension 3) to distinguish *actualized* vs. *potential* harm.  

---

#### **5. Fear and Hypervigilance**  
**Items**: 20, 26, 29, 35  
**Label Rationale**: Captures the victim’s internalized anxiety response to abuse, including *self-censorship* (e.g., hiding discomfort), *somatic fear* (e.g., "walking on eggshells"), and *anticipatory dread* (e.g., fearing interactions). Distinct from perpetrator behaviors (Dimensions 1–4), this dimension reflects the *psychological consequence* of chronic abuse, aligning with trauma theory’s focus on hypervigilance as a survival mechanism.  

---

#### **6. Healthy Relational Dynamics**  
**Items**: 9, 21, 27, 34, 36, 38, 41, 43, 46  
**Label Rationale**: A positive counterpoint to abuse dimensions, reflecting *mutual respect* (e.g., autonomy support, emotional safety) and *constructive communication* (e.g., conflict resolution without harm). Items cohere around secure attachment indicators (e.g., feeling heard, encouraged to grow). Included to highlight relational health contrasts—critical for scales assessing relationship quality, where reverse-coded items validate construct validity.  

---

#### **7. External Validation of Abuse**  
**Items**: 4, 24  
**Label Rationale**: Social network observations confirming abuse severity (e.g., friends/family expressing concern, disapproval of partner’s behavior). Though only two items, they form a distinct dimension reflecting *external corroboration*—a key factor in victims recognizing abuse (per "bystander effect" literature). Separated from Fear/Hypervigilance (Dimension 5) as it centers *others’ perceptions* rather than the victim’s internal state.

### Key Psychometric Notes  
- **Non-Overlap**: Dimensions are mutually exclusive (e.g., threats vs. physical violence; perpetrator actions vs. victim responses).  
- **Theoretical Grounding**: Aligns with established frameworks (e.g., coercive control, trauma bonding) to ensure construct validity.  
- **Conciseness**: Merged minor categories (e.g., sexual/physical violence) only where mechanisms overlapped; retained distinct factors for clinical precision (e.g., threats vs. enacted violence).  
- **Positive Items**: Grouped separately to avoid contaminating abuse dimensions, supporting bifactor scale designs where "health" and "abuse" are orthogonal constructs.  

This structure optimizes reliability (cohesive item groupings) and validity (clear theoretical distinctions), suitable for developing a multidimensional abuse assessment tool.
